"Avoid this site! I sent back 2 pairs of Nike Air Force 1s. When I didn't receive my refund after 2 weeks, I contacted them and they said they weren't going to refund me as the parcel didn't have the right items in. It absolutely did! I asked them to provide evidence that it didn't such as Evri confirmation of the parcel weight etc, and they ignored this and just kept saying no refund. They will absolutely steal your money!"
"I ordered the same pair of shoes twice and have yet to receive either order. The first item was due to be delivered to a collection point. I received an email from Evri stating that the parcel was ready for collection, but when I attended the collection point, my item was not there. I contacted customer services and was advised that they’d follow this up and respond it 48 hours to issue my refund. I’ve still not received a follow up email/response and it’s been over a week.I stupidly ordered the shoes again, assuming I’d receive my refund, this time to my house. The tracking shows that the item hasn’t been received by the courier 4 days after it was allegedly dispatched. Needless to say, I’m sceptical I’ll ever receive them.I’ve raised a PayPal dispute for both orders and will never shop with Zalando again. Wish I’d checked other reviews before wasting my time."
"Placed order to have delivered to a parcelshop. Delivery advised as between 1st and 4th November. Checking tonight, 3rd November, the tracking states ""we are expecting it"" and Evri say they have not been given the parcel as yet. Zalando state they dispatched it 30/10/23. Reading all the reviews on here and with the pathetic customer service I am thinking I too will not receive my parcel tomorrow. As someone else has stated, thank heavens I paid via PayPal and have their protection."
"Ordered a pair of trainers for my nephews birthday. They should have been delivered between 1/11/23 & 4/11/23. The tracking hasn't changed since the first and only email I received. According to the tracking the order hasn't been passed to the courier. That's been since Monday 30/10/23.I phoned the company today to find out what is happening.  Customer service was terrible.  The woman said she would chase it up and if I haven't received it on 2 working days to phone back. I said that wasn't an acceptable response, let me speak to your manager. She refused saying managers don't take calls. She then hung up."
"Great experience. I ordered a ralph lauren jacket and it was authentic. I ordered it the wrong size, returned it and got it in my actual size all within 2 weeks. They even price matched the coat for me. Great experience. 5 starts."
"Absolutely horrific company. Customer service is shockingly awful - I was cut off by them stating ‘have a good day’ when they didn’t want to answer my question. Items ordered ages ago and due by today at the latest and they haven’t even been shipped… asked for a refund so I can but else where and now refusing to do that! The company are thieves and this is a pattern by the looks of it, now having seen these reviews!!! I really hope people read these before using and being scammed like I have. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. AVOID AVOID AVOID"
"Ordered a shirt and got wrong size delivered. Not a big deal, returned it and reordered once again after assurance that the message would be passed to the warehouse team. Got it in the wrong size again - customer support suggested me to stop ordering from the store, so I'm passing this recommendation to you as well."
I placed an order on the 18th October for a pair of boots that I had been searching for in my size for weeks. Absolutely amazing service. The boots were delivered first thing Friday morning (20th October). Would definitely order from this site again.
Customer service seems to be run by robots. Two months after returning 2 items I am still waiting for the second refund. Told to check my bank statement and still no sign of either refund. Have now sent thirteen emails requesting refunds. Seems to be an Indian call centre. Use this company at your own risk.
"Just received my order of 2 t-shirts 4 days after ordering. Products exactly as described, prompt delivery, no issues whatsoever.Will shop with them again."
"Unreliable and Dismissive CompanyI've had enough of this company. A careless courier left my £157 dress outside, and he vanished before I could react.I reached out to Evri and Zalando, but their responses have been inadequate.My rights under the UK Consumer Rights Act place responsibility on the retailer, not the delivery company.Unfortunately, Zalando has not shown any willingness to address this.I contacted the CEOs, Mr. Shneider & Mr. Gentz, but it seems they're indifferent.The customer service team's responses were copy-paste, offering no real solutions.I've asked Zalando to delete my data, as I want nothing to do with them.This company repeatedly disregards its customers and fails to meet legal obligations in the UK market.The poor customer service reflects a problematic culture from the top down.I doubt they'll even honour my data deletion request.Paulina"
"Shocking service. Ordered the same pair of trainers 4 times and they kept on arriving damaged - scratches and marks, and a hole in the sole! Contacted customer service and received responses with unbelievable typos and incorrect English. Pay the extra and purchase elsewhere!"
"Found some Nike AF1s that my Daughter wanted and they were out of stock at the main retailers. Found Zalando had them in stock. After reading the mixed reviews I was really apprehensive with purchasing from Zalando but thought I'd give it a shot with Pay Pal buyers protection. Long story cut short...Order arrived today and it was perfect. Can't fault the service, product or delivery."
Zalando are real scammers. They charge customers claiming bills are not paid and they are outstanding. Customer service in Switzerland cannot speak English either.They deducted 10CHF from my refund claiming it is for delivery.Real Scammers !!!
"They are STILL sending me invoices on a parcel i returned and i have evidence from their own page it was paid fully! They seem to change the data on their site ! i did a screen shot from my order when it said on their own site it was paid (the payment is also registered on my netbank),,,and NOW it says on their site that its not paid and they keep sending me invoices! (well,they will not win and they have lost an excellent customer who has already given them thousands of £££££ on my shoppings so far,BUT NEVER AGAIN! ) IF you choose to shop in this rotton place DO SCREEN SHOT all moves so you have evidence when they are trying to FOOOCK you over! Esp the return part,this is where they obviously are screwing a lots of people over and clearly they are very experienced to scam people that way! NEVER AGAIN ZALANDO!!!NEVER AGAIN!!!! say BHYE BHYE to MY MONEY SCAMLANDO!!!!🖕"
"I'm another scammed customer!Returned 3 pairs of shoes worth £350 using the two provided return labels.One parcel was lost by Evri, the other parcel arrived in the warehouse after 3 days.Zalando refused to send me the refund for both parcels without giving a reason. Apparently they don't refund lost parcels (which is highly illegal) and as so many others experienced, Zalando claimed that the other parcel arrived empty.I wrote countless emails and only got copy and paste answers.I wrote a ""letter before action"" but got no reply, so I had no other option as to file for a charge back with my bank.Today I finally won the case! It took so much time and caused so much stress but it was worth it.I included a collection of trustpilot reviews to emphasise that Zalando is scamming their customers on a regular basis.Please do yourself a favour and don't order from them."
"Yet another rejected refund. I sent back 2 pairs of shoes as they were not what I wanted in the end.  I actually ordered another pair that I kept (but before the refund disaster.Anyway - returned 2 pairs of shoes and a top. The refunded me for a top saying I never sent shoes. They supposedly did internal investigation in which they rejected my claim. Unfortunately, they refused to provide me any proof of what was checked and who was contacted. It only took them 5 days to reject the claim, which means they haven't even contacted the courier (Evri) and just rejected the claim assuming the customer is wrong... Never had such a bad experience before. Even Vinted took time to look into one of my claims, contacted inPost and refunded me and the seller money.Avoid Zalando as this is a common practice now across Europe."
"I have been shopping at Zalando for many many years now and I love the website, I am utterly broken to see so many negative votes, but my experience have been always solid 10/10 and the customer service team have always been super cooperative and great!The brands are ace, very good prices and even better promotions, fav place to shop!"
I ordered a pair of Skechers Wide FitSlip In Trainers which arrived on time.The only thing was i did not receive a confirmation email after i made the purchase which i found a little strange but after reading FAQ on Zalando's mailing policy it stated an email would be sent once your order as shipped which was correct in my case.
"The most horrendous experience. I wish I had read the reviews before ordering, it seems like it's a common practice to not refund the returns.I ordered a pair of trainers, they were too small and I returned them the following day. Some days after I receive an email saying they couldn't refund me because they had received some white jeans from another brand! Instead of the trainers. I explained many times I packed the trainers myself and used the return label they provided. How's it possible my parcel was exchanged for some item that was never in my possession in the first place. They refuse to answer to me and customer service very rudely cut me off. They only gave me the option to accept the fraudulent white jeans back, or not. I lost my money. Stay away!"
"DON'T RETURN MORE THAN 1 ITEM PER PARCEL!  I sent 2 things back together, only got refunded for 1. Zalando told me to wait 14 days, then had me fill in a claim form, then asked for a copy of my driving licence, only then to tell me the warehouse had said only 1 item was in the parcel & refused to issue the missing refund.Customer services agreed to send my complaint to a manager but I haven't heard back, despite chasing for 2 weeks; they just ignore my emails.As I've been unable to 'prove' the pacel had 2 items in, with just an Evri parcel receipt & the online return request, it's their word against mine.I had been a customer for about 10 years but not any more; zero stars!"
"Worst experience ever!Avoid at all costs, i have purchased multiple items from them and when i returned some back they went missing somehow even tough i have returned them and Zalando did absolutely nothing to protect me what a shame of a company i will never buy again from them and would not recommend it ever! Lost £1,000 my last hope is to raise a dispute with the bank!"
Disappointed.I've ordered before and always been happy  but this time I needed to return the item.I had to contact customer services as the return label and information wasn't provided.Drop of was easy but it took the full 14 days to email me with a refund.Disappointed with the lengthy returns process and will not be a retuning customer because of this.
First order with Zalando.co.ukAfter trawling the net for a particular item found it at Zalando at a great price and bought another sale item.  Both items delivered within delivery timeframe (Evri).  Both legit brands.  Happy customer 👍
"Excellent company. I was kept updated about my order. I emailed to ask a question and had a response very quickly. Great product and cheaper than everywhere else, got some trainers I'd wanted for ages. There was a fair few bad reviews, but people will always write bad ones and very rarely will come back to write a positive review, but my experience was nothing but positive."
"NEVER F’UCKING EVER AGAIN!!!!!IM SOOO ANGRY!!!! I RETURNED THE GOODS IN JUNE 2022, ITS JANUARY 2023, NO REFUND YET!!! I HAVE PROOFS OF SENDING, SPOKE TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, FILLED LEGAL DISCLAIMERS, STILL NOTHING!!!!! I SPEAK EVERY TIME TO DIFFERENT PERSON WHO CLEARLY DOESNT UNDERSTAND WHOLE CASE, SOOOO FRUSTRATING, F’UCK YOU ZALANDO!!!! JUST F’UCKYOUUUU!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAWEFULL EXPERIENCE, NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!IM USING GOLDEN ASOS!!!!!!!!F’UCKING ZALANDO NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!! IM SOOOOOO ANGRY!!!!"
"Early day but …. I messaged the company throu their website and…. Discovered the courier I’d Hermes/Evri.  The courier isn’t to blame thou, I wondered why I couldn’t track my order, reason … Hermes/Evri haven’t even got it!!!  Now they want me to complete a form, no great shekels, except the signature needs to a proper signature … how to do that I wonder?   I have no computer, printer or laptop.  It’s crazy they gave my £109, have never given it to courier but they want me to jump throu hoops to fit in with their procedures?"
"This company is a scam. I have been with this company for over 7 years but in the last 2 years they have become fraudulent, complacent and dishonest. I have returned to them now 3-4 times where my return shows returned by Evri and they refuse to issue refund. The last one is a £100 worth of  trainers. They have tracking even on there website stating it was returned. Yet they have refused to issue my refund. I paid with PayPal but PayPal buyer protection is useless. Now I am thinking of reporting to trade standards and action fraud. Stay clear of them"
"Best company, with the best customer support. Courier left my package on the mail box and it got stolen, they refunded money in a few days, with no questions asked. Great service"
"I had ordered a white Size 17 shirt as i needed a shirt for my dads funeral coming up in just over a week however I received a size 16.5 which i passed off as a one time error so I quickly went on to order another size 17 shirt and proceeded to return the 16.5 shirt that i had received in error only for me to order it a second time with a mere few days to the funeral and imagine my shock at receiving another 16.5 shirt after clearly ordering a size 17 one, I am beyond gutted at this level of incompetence."
"Purchased the Anna Field ""classic heels"" in light pink, and I love them! I'm not a high-heel person, but I needed some for my upcoming wedding, and literally have zero qualms about Zalando! They used Evri as the courier, and I must be lucky because Evri is pretty good in my area. Easy purchase, quick delivery, and sizing is perfect - a lot of the negative reviews here focus on Zalando's return or refund system or the courier's delivery, but as I won't be returning these shoes, it's five stars from me! :D"
"Worse company like many others trying to get a refund from these robbers is a joke. I send my parcel back  I have proof of returning however it never arrived,  so no surprise there either.  If you read other reviews that’s there usual line.   Disgusting company avoid at all costs i am now £88 out of pockets . Day light robbery."
"If there would be a 0 stars option I would choose that one. Bramw. and his colleagues are rude, seem to not understand English to the level they need in order to work their job or have not received needed training. Telling a long term customer that other customers are more important and the address something was delivered to due to Zalando's mistake and causing issues to get a refund due to Zalando's missing capability to do a simple job is really sad. Even if the products on their website would be great, the humans behind the scenes are clearly not listening or interested to solve Zalando caused issues."
"Excellent service for purchase and refund.After seeing all the bad reviews regarding Zalando I had to add my recent experience.What can I say!? No drama or issues.I purchased two items as I wasn't sure on sizing. They arrived on time.I then returned the item that wasn't suitable and I was not only refunded within a few days, but they also kept me up to date with my refund process.No hesitation in purchasing from them again :)Great price and easy transaction :) Very happy!"
I ordered a pair of Nike trainers I then read the bad reviews and considered cancelling my order ....I decided to hang In with my order as they were 50 pounds cheaper than anywhere elseThey arrived as described and on time so I can't comment on the return issues people talk about but thought I'd share my experience to hopefully help someone
I've used Zalando a few times and so far my experience has been positive. I've had a couple of issues with orders going missing and a partner (Massimo Dutti) failing to refund a return. Both times Zalando's support team have been quick to resolve these issues with positive outcomes. Emails are usually answered within 2 hours and refunds are instant.Recommended!
I returned an item to Zalando via Evri. I have contacted Zalando Customer Service and they said that the parcel has not been received back to their warehouse. However the system has showed that the parcel has been handed by Hermes. Zalando just said that my situation is an unusual and this is why their specialized team cannot offer me a refund. I have been going trough same issues since February - I have been asking for refund at least 6 times for different orders. This is not correct practice. I would not recommend shopping at Zalando
"This is my first time ordering from zalando, i bought shoes from them and now i can see package delivered in my mail box today saturday and i was home all day no call or knock, i went and check it there was nothing, how do i have my money back? This is nonsense and i'm angry 😠😠"
AVOID at all cost. Scammers. Worst experience ever!!!Zalando is a SCAM. Avoid at all cost or you will lose your money. I purchased 5 items and returned all of them. Zalando confirmed they had received the items however soon after changed their decision claiming the items went missing and refused to issue refund. It is very clear they SCAM customers and steal their money. Dispute with the Bank and Small Claim Court is the way to deal with them!!!Would NOT recommend at all!!!
"My experiences have been good. I have placed 4 orders over the years. Three of the orders being trainers, 2x nike trainers which I was extremely happy with and the other trainers being vans which came in squished. Could have been the way they was handled in transit though. Overall happy with the items I've brought."
Decent clothing! Have had several orders from this site and clothing always fits true to size. Pricing has sky rocketed though even in the sale but before was much more affordable. Big let down from this also they only rarely give you a small discount code.
"Not sure why Zalando UK have such poor ratings! I've shopped with them for  a long time  now and always  had a great experience, with  brilliant prices and fast free delivery- my last order was on Friday 10th Feb; the item has arrived a day early and  it was also  the  lowest  price of  any other  online retailer. I'd thoroughly recommend them! I'm also very impressed that they  now use letter type packaging for  trainers rather  than   huge boxes which can be difficult if you have to carry them for any length of time !"
"Comon guys, contacted you by your email 2 times and nobody return any call. Sending products throug cheap delivery company is not the best ideea. Order a pair of shoes on 19 June and still this product is not delivered.Order number: 10501020294842Spent £120 and nobody call me or text me what is happening with my order. Zalando use to be a trust company."
Shame that somehow my Evri parcel from Zalando was apparently damaged beyond repair.Please to say was fairly easy to contact Zalando and receive refund even though me thinks maybe1- Evri and Zalando should have been taking the time and making the effort to sort not me.2- Some compensation or good will gesture would have been reasonable.
"Avoid!! avoid!! avoid!! my order got lost by evri, I have emailed & spoken multiple times to Zalando they keep telling me to fill a legal Statement in which they then keep telling me its not acceptable, basically I'm nearly £100 out of pocket & there's no help what so ever from customer services  shocking company!!"
"Was a bit nervous placing an order having read some of the reviews here but that is what’s made me now come and add my own review as my experience was all smooth and there were no problems at all. Placed order, received tracking info, item was unfortunately too small so I returned it for free and got a full refund. No issues and email updates were received each step of the way. Would shop with them again without hesitation."
I read the very bad reviews about zalando and decided to risk ordering a pair of doc martens as they were so much cheaper than other companies.  I received an email immediately with order confirmation. I was kept up to date about delivery from Yodel ( who were excellent). The boots arrived beautifully packed and are gorgeous. I was so happy with my experience. Liz. 👍 x
"Horrible,company from hellLiterally a scamReceived my items from Massimo Dutti ,nothing fit me and  I wanted to return all order, return label was attached in parcel, no receipt , no return form,so I assumed that’s how it’s working ,put everything back and courier collected my return parcel. One month passed ,I have no money  and no clothing .Great scam scheme ."
"I purchased a product but didn't like the product so ended up returning it via Evri. As per Zalando, they received the parcel empty. After following up for more than a month they denied issuing my refund. I highly recommend using other platforms like asos but never use Zalando."
I returned an item to Zalando via Evri. Zalando have said the parcel has not been received back to their warehouse. Zalando have also said that lost returns by use of Evri are the responsibility of the customer and that they will not be issuing a refund. This is not correct practice. I will be contacting Trading Standards about this. I would not recommend shopping at Zalando
"I was a zalando customer for years and always i paid with paypal.I never had any problem with them.This week i try to buy some clothes but at the checkout i only had the option to pay by card.I contact the customer service and i was told that they cant do nothing about because its the system who decides and they can't  change that.Poor explanation and no solution, so bye bye zalando."
"Held back a refund (£152) for no reason. Held back translated as “on this occasion we have decided not to refund you. This case is now closed”… Even though I returned using their own instructed courier (Evri) and had the receipt I dropped it off. Had to speak to the bank to try and cancel, (section 75) then Citizens advice (they were very helpful) and then 2 hours uploading various documents.Update: 3rd March:Eventually refunded after sending 4 rights to cancel emails. Senior management stepped in and refunded it, but offered no reason why this happened, or any compensation upon my request. I had shopped here since 2013. Not any more. My advice is read all these other reviews and stay well clear…"
"Sadly have been caught by the dreaded returns curse that it looks like others have. Sent back items from an order across 2 parcels and they're claiming they haven't received items and, therefore, refusing to refund me. I've spoken to 2 different people on the phone who have assured ne they will resolve it...and then I never hear from them again. And emailing is pointless because you never speak to the same person, they don't bother to read through the prior communication, ask you to submit the same information over and over and over and then fob you off with lies. I've ended up having to submit a claim via my card provider because its become ridiculous"
"Purchased a gift card, somehow they cancelled the purchase due to suspicion of fraud, the person who received the gift card couldn't retrieve it and after about 20 email exchanges with different agents I never heard back. I purchased the item on the 9th of January and no one has ever got back to me. It's now the 14th of February.May have to file a formal complaint."
Not issuing a refund on my item and stating that I sent them an empty box with nothing inside??Giving no evidence of their 'investigation team findings'Avoid!
Company are thieves. I have reported to actionfraud and trading standards.They send faulty goods .They then tell me they don't have my return even though evri claim it to be returned. Then they 'investigate ' and tell me box was empty upon arrival.So I ask them to investigate this  I wanted them to speak to evri and warehouse.  But they wouldn't. They told me they would not do anything.You cannot speak to evri as the return is paid for by zalando . This seems like a scam by zalando to keep people's items and money. It seems to be happening a lot from reviews.  I am sick to my stomach.  This is disgusting.
"I would give this company minus stars if possible. I purchased a Mango jumper through Zalando. The jumper was worn once and the seam from the shoulder area opened up revealing half my armpit and left me in a compromised position at work, absolutely embarrassing! I complained to Zalando and asked for a solution as this is not something that should happen after one wear. They offered me a 5% return discount. 5%?! I can't wear the damaged jumper at all as the hole in such an awkward area that can't be stitched up either. They continued to refuse a proper compensation saying they have assessed the pics and think 5% refund is acceptable. I am absolutely disgusted. They evidently sell damaged items and offer no refund. Return option is that YOU pay for your return yourself. How ridiculous. Will never buy again from them. Awful company."
"Surprised to see such a low rating in here. Never had issues, always deliver on time, returns are quick and easy. Once I ordered a jumper from their partner (Esprit were responsible for delivery instead of Zalando), I didn't like it and returned back. Never heard back from Esprit, however, contacted Zalando and they gave me a refund. Overall very positive experience. They also offer genuine discounts during Black Friday/Christmas sale etc."
"Absolutely appalling customer service. Item not delivered and now the CS team keep asking for documents to be filled in, that have to be sent back in certain formats. Send the one they ask for, and unsurprisingly, they need another. Almost certainly a scam. This has been back and forwarding for nearly 2 weeks."
Considering the poor reviews here I had a really good experience. Item came promptly after ordering. Wasn't right so sent it back. 3 weeks later no word but EVRI tracking hadn't shown it as delivered. I rang Zalando and they said they could see the problem was with Evri and so refunded me in full on the spot.
"I was a little worried after seeing some reviews, even though I know they are a legit company. However, my experience was perfect, the trainers I ordered came in good time, where the cheapest ones of that style I could find on the internet. I will use them again without any hesitation."
"They make money from stealing your returns. Item returned but they claim box arrived empty - how convenient - see other reviews - see a pattern emerging? They refuse to refund my son's money, yet they were happy to snatch it from him: the only way he could use a gift card was to open an account - DO NOT DO THIS - they deny access to account. Customer service is a sick joke. Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy high stress and throwing money away. You will never see your money again. CROOKS."
"I ordered a swimming costume. It arrived with no hygiene sticker on it. Not only that, it looked like someone had worn it as it was dirty in the groin area. How gross and disappointing."
"After reading awful reviews I was a bit worried about my purchase as a first time buyer from this company …..My order for skechers boots arrived well within the time frame, boxed, tags still on and in pristine condition, I paid £37 compared to £90 on Skechers site.I found this company easy to deal with and extremely good on prices. I would happily recommend to family and friends based on my experience."
"Terrible company, been trying to order trainers and an error message occurs when trying to add to bag. Tried various colours of the trainers. Sent numerous messages to customer services and have been unhelpful, clearly out of stock but website does not reflect this. I purchased a discount voucher to purchase so it makes it more frustrating. They tell me they are in stock but cannot order for me. Been trying for days and am getting no help."
"Wasn't to sure at 1st if to order anything after reading mixed reviews.I purchased a hat that was out of stock with Puma, however Zalando had the hat.Upon ordering the process was very slow even to shipping from Zalando.I was given a delivery date 17th-19th...my item wasn't shipped till the end but received on the 19th.Overall Item received & as described."
Avoid this company they do not refund you for lost packages even with substantial evidence they seem to think it’s ok to say no to everything I will take this further with my bank see how they like it rubbish customer service avoid at all cost
"This company are a disgrace! They are fraudsters. Do not use ever!!Shoes returned via Evri, they did not arrive and were lost by Evri now Zalando will not refund item. This has been going on 2 months still no refund. The only advice the customer team can give is to raise a police report. I am £120 out of pocket and cannot get a resolution. I have phoned every day and all I’m being told is case is closed and no refund will be given.Please do not use this company they should not be trading. Illegal practices."
Bad service looking to buy trainers they advertise trainers on there site that you cant even buy! I contacted supported its even bad they dont even understand don’t even know why there for business joke of a company
"I’ve had some issues with Zalando but they more or less were solved but this one is just worrying and upsetting. I returned a pair of Jordans and after a while realised they weren’t refunded so I contacted Zalando, they confirmed they had received them, made me sign a form and then said that they didn’t receive them and they cannot refund me until I return them. I was just dismissed and now I’m being completely ignored. it’s a lot of money I have lost. I’ve also returned another order and I don’t know if the same thing will happen again.I think people should be aware and be careful ordering from Zalando because this may happen to you!"
"They don't accept Evri receipt as evidence of return and as per the other comments, declined to process the refund. Had to ask credit card to raise a dispute adding to the time/frustration. Customer service is very poor."
I didn’t even want to leave 1 star. Horrible customer service. Never got my order and they refusing doing anything about it and refusing to refund me. Have been transferred to so many different people. No management to talk to. Don’t order it from them!
Never buy from Zalando. After returning my item because it didn’t fit they then declined my refund given the item wasn’t in an acceptable condition… there was nothing wrong with the item and it was exactly how I had received it. Still waiting for the item to be returned 3 weeks later! Useless!
"Was very worried about my order after seeing the reviews here, but can only talk about my personal experience which was good. Parcel was delivered and tracked by Yodel - although there was a slip under Evri inside the parcel? The delivery driver came in a car with no lights on at night as well and may have missed me if I wasn’t on the ball! Presume he was agency. However, ordered late Thursday and received Monday, and item was exactly as wanted - cannot complain. Only advice I can give to anyone ordering is that delivery issues may be Christmas related however cannot speak on refund issues as did not need one and can only review own experience which was good. Would advise someone to order at their own risk."
"returned a 165 hoodie, they wont refund me or give me my item back!! scamming company, paid by giftcard so cant even do a charge back. filling in their legal form told they will investiagte and get back to me in 3-5 days. after 20mins a email saying sorry we wont refund you. end off..!! avoid this scamming company."
"Lots of bad reviews from people having troubles with returning items, I paid by Amex for an extra layer of security.Can't comment on that as I'm keeping the item.  So overall, happy customer."
This is the worst online retail experience I have ever endured. They managed to send me the wrong item 3 times consecutively and know I have to wait 14 days each time to get my money back.I will never use this company again their customer service is disgraceful
"Was sceptical to order after reading the reviews but so glad I did. Product ordered was £20 cheaper than original retailer, and had a better selection of sizes. Placed my order on 18.02.23 and it arrived on 23.02.23, via Yodel. Updates of the order status were excellent and I’m glad I decided to order from Zalando."
"Received a voucher but it was in STG (Im in Rep of Irl). No where when purchasing the voucher did it mention it could only be used for UK customers. I tried using it on the .ie website which it wouldnt allow me.I then decided to purchases on .co.uk and pay the shipping costs myself, however i was told that site can only be used within the UK. I asked them to refund the voucher and they refused, basically telling me tough luck that the voucher was essentially useless to me"
I ordered RL trainers online and received the parcel today. I opened to be shocked to see that the trainers are child size and also the WRONG item. NEVER EVER Again. Keep away!!!!!
I keep having dreadful experiences returning items to Zalando (different orders). Refund never arrives and you have to keep chasing them up for your money back weeks later. It's almost as if they want you to forget about your return and keep the money. It's annoying having to contact them over and over again literally begging them for a refund.
First time using this company. Youngest son needed football boots so went shopping and of course the shop didn’t have his size. So was told to order his size off their shop website. So popped on the net and came across this website with the same boots but £27 cheaper. (£32 if I included the other company’s delivery charge) I’ve never heard of this company so decided to check out the reviews on Trustpilot. It was a bit worrying seeing all the negative feedback but I found a large portion of it is around their return policy. We knew the boots would fit as he tried on how many pairs in the other shop so decided to take the risk. Ordered Tuesday and arrived by Thursday. Happy son and happy wallet.
"I ordered Nike Air Max trainers on the 8th Dec for my Christmas, they were supposed to be delivered 12th Dec. I still don’t have them. As with all the other reviews, I had to fill out a legal document and send back in PDF format. That was over a week ago, still no refund or replacement. Customer service just telling me to be patient while they investigate. Worst customer service ever, I will never use this company again."
"If like me you have had problems getting a refund from zalando whereby they have outright refused to give a refund for a return that they did receive then contact your bank and make a charge back/section 75 application. This has worked for me and I have been able to get my money back.As this company is registered in Germany the EU also have a small claims court you can apply to. I would also request CCTV of their warehouse receiving your parcel and push for them to look into the matter. You will most likely be stonewalled with a generic response that goes something like "" This is an unusual situation, and when it does occasionally happen, our specialized team treats each order individually."" It's not an unusual situation at all they are useless and scamming people."
"Item sent to me in a used condition! This is probably one of the more bizarre experiences I've had shopping online, but I can't say I'm surprised looking at the reviews. The football boots we're shipped to me in a used condition, the laces were completely undone, there were no tags on the item and the box was completely plain and not a Nike branded box as it should have been. Just a plain brown box with my boots inside. First and last time shopping at Zalando I think."
"I had the most pathetic retail experience with Zalando. I had bought one Emporio Armani tshirt from them and had returned it back to them. Since I did not get my refund within the 14 day period, I contacted the customer service and they made me sign a legal document. After that they denied my refund stating my package did not reach their warehouse. Once I sent them a proof from the courier service that it was delivered, they said that the article wasn’t there and refund cannot be provided. When I asked them to send me a picture of the package or return the package with whatever article was inside, they denied that as well. It looks like the brand is stealing from customers by denying them refunds for their returns lately. Absolutely horrible, Will highly recommend NOT SHOPPING WITH ZALANDO!"
"Horrible experience!1st time I ordered a coat and I kept waiting and waiting for it to arrive. At one point, I log into the account to try to track the order and my order appeared as ""returned"", despite the fact that it never got to me. talked to chat support and they told me it was a logistic error and that they apologize and yadda-yadda.I set an alert to notify me when the coat is back in stock, I manage to order it. I log into my account a few days later  only to see that the order was canceled, no notification email about that, and no money back in my account yet!Very disapointing!"
"As someone mentioned below, they make their money by stealing your returns. I sent my return back using their return label provided, and my parcel tracking has suddenly vanished when it was there the week before. They conducted a “thorough investigation” in about a couple of hours and just flat out refused to refund a jacket without providing me any further details.Now they are not listening to a word I am saying to them and they are just saying they will not refund me, for a jacket I sent back about a month ago. They advised I could contact the carrier about my parcel but this should be their job since my agreement is with Zalando!"
I was worried after reading bad reviews on here. But they were the only place I could find the particular colour of trainers I wanted so I ordered. They came really quickly no problems whatsoever and I love my new trainers. I would definitely order from zalando again.
I ordered a pair of doc martens sandals using a 15% off code. Within 1 month a strap on the right sandal snapped off! Sandals were returned and refund given. I asked Zalando if I would be able to the order the sandals at the price I had originally paid for them as this was no fault of my own that the first pair were faulty. Zalando refused to do this!
Ordered several time from Zalando now and never had a problem. Always quick delivery and great quality items.Returned items as well and always very straight forward.
DISGRACEFUL COMPANY!!!! Waiting for a refund for an item I returned over 3 months ago!!! They’re claiming they can’t refund me because it hasn’t reached the warehouse. Well obviously the parcel is now lost and they need to make a claim through Evri and give me my money back!!!! SCAMMERS!!!!!I have spoke to multiple brain dead people and no one can give me a resolution!!! I just want my money back you crooks. Terrible way to do business and you’ll be closed down soon enough!!!!
"Item didn’t arrive, Evri had apparently lost it. Zalando wouldn’t send out the item again, was told to I’ll be refunded and will have to reorder again. The item has conveniently gone up by £30, Zalando won’t honour the original price."
Disgraceful company. They have used evri to try and delivery some trainers I have ordered that have never been delivered. They have the tracking number and can see this but will not refund me… they keep requesting a ‘legal statement’ even though I have emailed them about 30 times
I have been trying to track and find out what company is delivering my order but it is very difficult to say the least. I have now found tracking number and the delivery company is Yodel which are the worst courier company with the worst app I have ever dealt with.Very frustrated customer
"I purchased trainers first, then decided to read reviews about the shop. They were a bit worrying. Received new trainers within a week, was nothing wrong with them. So everything went smooth. I am giving 5 stars"
"AVOID this website. I ordered the same shoe in two different sizes (two separate orders as received the first pair and they didn’t fit) both shoes didn’t fit so I returned them both with the label provided in my parcel. The Evri tracking status has not updated since I sent either parcel back, so I got in contact after a couple of weeks regarding my refund. I was asked to fill in a form and send proof of return for both orders – they refunded me for one, but refuse to refund me for the other with no real reason – I have provided as much information as I can! They are rude, unhelpful and have stolen my money! I have now resorted to making a claim with my bank, so hopefully they can help me get my money back. Wish I had looked into this company a bit more before ordering from them, complete scammers, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!"
Having bought from Zalando in the past with no problem I did not hesitate to order from them again last week.  However I seem to have fallen into the same trap many others have mentioned.  My item has never been delivered after 5 days of waiting.  I have now had to send their legal form twice and will probably have to do it again.  Emails always come back from a different person who never seems to read what has previously been said.  They always state they are sorry and will try to resolve the problem but so far there is no evidence of this.  Think twice before you buy from them.
Zalando customer service is v poor. Ordered a pair of trainers which arrived squashed and extremely damp in a broken up box. Submit a claim form multiple times and emailed them over and over again with no resolution. Just kept sending me the same claims form to fill in. Useless
Not had any problems with my orders. However today got an update from Evri that my parcels been delayed. We have an amazing delivery driver very trustworthy. On his rounds I asked do you know what happened to my parcel today. He said the parcel was open and didn’t want to deliver it. He also mentioned there were small items in the parcel which doesn’t sound like a baseball cap. I contacted zalando and all they said was they spoken to Evri and it be delivered tomorrow????? So I defiantly will be refusing delivery as I trust our driver and won’t deal with the nonsense proving stuff to zalando. People make me sick. Someone in the depot has stolen the hat. I would like to advise anyone struggling to get refunds please contact your bank and make a charge back claim. It might be a bit time consuming but your get what’s rightfully yours. Don’t let any company take your money.
The most re tarded customer service I've ever dealt with in my life. These clowns are only able to ask you for your order number and if you don't have one then their brains do not work. I've been waiting 3-weeks for a refund for two orders I made that never came because they wasn't processed properly so I didn't get any order number. Luckily I paid through PayPal which allowed me to make a dispute but now they are taking a lifetime to respond to PayPal because they are so dumb. I've spoken to five or six useless African customer call centre people. I've emailed them and instead of dealing with my enquiry they just kept saying oh will be refunded automatically just wait. So 3 weeks later I'm still waiting for my refund and these ediots can't even respond to PayPal. Now I know why I haven't used them since 2016 advise that you never use this company they are stupid bee itches
"The website is great, but their customer 'service' is beyond awful. This review is directly related to customer care.I waited over two months for a refund. I asked for my case to be escalated to speak with a manager and they didn't do it. I must have asked 10 times. They work by just sending generic emails over and over again, and because you speak to a different person each time, no one is being held accountable. Zalando, what is the point in having loads of customer service members if no one is trained to actually care or try to help? Your processes are so restrictive it's impossible to actually help someone.I can see now other people complaining about the same thing. Its a shame!Worst customer care experience of my life."
"This company has started causing me problems in the last month. They have claimed that two items I have sent back had signs of use. This is a lie, nothing was used and the items were sent back exactly how they were received. Upon asking for photos of the claimed use, I was shocked to see that they made the items have dirt marks to try and falsly accuse me of sending a used item back and refused to give me a refund. Stay away from this company and if your returning items take detailed pictures on the day of dispatch!!! But best to avoid this company"
"They say that my order has been delivered and signed, but I have never received it.Update: they are unprofessional and after filling in their complaint form 6 times, they told me ""we are glad you are happy with your order""."
"About 3 years ago I purchased a leather jacket for my son from Zalando - the whole purchasing experience and quality of item was great.  He has now outgrown this jacket so it will be passed on as still in great condition.He asked for a new leather jacket this year but initially chose one from another company- disaster. XL was more like 3XL so needed to go back - 2nd disaster no free return and came from China although registered in Canada - total cost to return = £40+ and customs paperwork!!.  So we are keeping it until it fits!!Happily my son's next choice was another leather jacket from Zalando.  Ordered on 29/12/22 arrived today 5/1/23 - perfect fit, condition, notifications and tracking all the way.  (Would have been a free return if not right).For me this company has given a 5 star service."
"Shocking behaviour when I returned trainers through Evri which they lost zalando refused to refund me telling me to report to police or get a solicitor!I have had to pay £115 for nothing I’m so angry it’s not fair , never shopping with zalando again"
Believe this is a fake company 2 things ordered and they told me it was delivered but their evidence was just a blank picture. Then asked me to sign a legal document to move forward so not believe they had any intention of delivering my stuff an now trying to get my money back is going to go on for a while do not touch this website
"They claimed that my return wasn’t acceptable even though I returned the item exactly how I received it. And when I communicated this via email, they disregarded my claims and refused to outline what was wrong with the shoes to decline my refund request."
"Saw a pair of NMD R1s on Zalando that were alot cheaper and in my size where as elsewhere they were £150-£200 in my size so snapped them up quickly. I then read the reviews and my heart sank.I checked on the delivery each day to see if it was updated until one day (a few days later than scheduled) it said the parcel was on the way. The trainers then turned up a few days before the new delivery date. I checked they were legit and had no problems at all, so very happy."
Terrible customer service. The item I ordered never arrived and when I contacted customer service they said that I was the problem and that the package did get delivered when I had proof that it didn’t. they didn’t allow me to even give proof and they refused to give me their so called concrete proof of the delivery. This is the second time this has happened. Do not order from here it is a scam!
"I ordered a pair of Calvin Klein women’s long boots in a size 7. The order came within the time frame stated, however they sent me a pair of MENS timberland shoes in a size 10.Currently going through the returns process so we shall see if I get my money back.. AVOID"
"Absolutely horrible experience, received a faulty item and they have not been helping at all.This item has very obviously been worn before with a dent in the platform of the heel. No management available to talk to me. I’ve told them I need this item for a special event they ignored everything. I was trying to be okay with the faulty item and accept a refund for a percentage as i urgently needed these shoes. Customer service were rude and extremely unhelpful. Received a email I need to send the item back like I’ve ruined it when within 30 minutes of receiving the item I made a complaint. Unbelievable never shopping here again. Clearly no one checks the returns that come in from customs or they think they can get away with selling faulty items."
"Do NOT use this company, that takes zero responsibility and no accountability when it comes to return/refund. I have provided proof of ID & receipt & waited 14 days and all the response I get is:I've checked your return tracking with the carrier and unfortunately, we haven't received the return of your 10504019735115 in our warehouse yet.Therefore, we cannot offer you a refund for the article(s).This is the second time Zalando is putting me and many other customers in a difficult situation. When I call them the girls who pick up the phone is literally speechless don't know what to say as everything on my side is done right. She asks her manager why the reason is and the answer that I have given is open a dispute with PayPal to get your money. Very unprofessional, joke company.I would NOT recommend to anyone. Stay away from this company definitely a scam."
I was quite concerned after seeing the reviews on here but decided to take a risk. I had no issues at all. The trainers I ordered were exactly as described and the delivery was very fast. So much so that I've just placed another order with them.
I am horrified by these bad reviews - I was about to part with my money on a jacket I cannot find elsewhere.  I am now not going to use Zalando - I would rather go without than put good money after bad... thank you for sharing these and saving me money and hassle
"Please stay clear of this company, I can’t understand how companies like this are allowed to trade! My parcel wasn’t delivered when calling their customer service centre staff were speaking poor English, so very difficult to understand them and they couldn’t understand me. Eventually they said I could have a refund however to get this refund you have print off the form fill it out and scan this back to them, you can’t do this electronically as your signature needs to be in pen. They make it extremely difficult probably hoping in this situation people won’t bother. Eventually and hopefully they will give a refund however I have seen when people do this this doesn’t happen. Not a chance would I give money to this company again I feel like I have been scammed."
Don't be fooled and don't ever get the risk with these filthy b*****s! I got scammed 2 times.I returned goods costing £400 few months ago and barely got my money back after roughly 2 months. Recently i returned items costing £70 and goods disappeared.They are doing something with Evri! Evri is a s*** company too! There are some nasty thieves (from the staff) who are doing the whole scenario! Don't take the risk! And if you got scammed please contact the Police and report this sh** company!
"As others have said I was very scepticle about ordering after seeing all the bad reviews. They were the only company to have the trainers in stock in the size I needed so I took the gamble. They had the best price and the stock, they arrived within 2 days so over all I would highly recommend."
"Utterly shocking customer service. I have returned some unwanted items purchased from Massimo Dutti via Zalando. I have the tracking info (confirming the parcel had reached the receiver), all the evidence imaginable INCLUDING Zalando App saying the return was received. And still they claim they do not have the parcel and therefore I am not to be refunded. The customer service keeps gaslighting me, no one is accountable for anything and there is no real email or address to reach out to. I’ve lost countless of hours trying to get any explanation but apparently Zalando is not in the business of fulfilling their T&C and providing any sort of customer service. Polite telephonists informing me that there is nothing they can do is NOT it!"
"I have been Zalando customer in France for many years and had great experience.  I continued shopping on Zalando in the UKI and I've just realised that they systematically refuse to refund for the items I returned to them.  One case - the whole return was lost, 2 cases Zalando claimed that I didn't ship all the items basically implying that I was committed a fraud by asking to be refunded for the ""items"" that were not in the box.   I plan to reach out to the German headquarters as I know the company is capable to provide an excellent service and there is really a major issue in the UKI"
Placed an order and needed to return. My order arrived quickly but unfortunately my return parcel got lost in transit on the way back. I received excellent customer service with regard my lost return. I got a response within minutes of supplying documents required and will receive full refund. Really recommend this site.
"Shame there is not 0 stars because that is what they would get , worst company I've ever dealt with they didnt deliver your items and don't refund , advise to anyone never use this company"
"Zalando is refusing to pay me my money back. Warehouse is a mess, they claim that the item was not to be found in the return parcel which is a lie since I have send all the items in one parcel. How come did I get refund for the rest of the items then?After many calls and messages with different Zalando employees still no success of getting my money back. I'm only annoyed by ridiculous messages like "" we cannot refund you, thanks for your understanding"". Well, no. No understanding here, could I just have my £108 back please??Their products are nice but where is the point if you lose your money because of the warehouse mess? Will never order anything from there again."
I returned my package and I have proof for receiving package by zalando but they sent me email that they don’t get any package also they didn’t refund me back it was £355. Never buy from them .
"Ordered a UK 13 trainer and received a UK12 - how difficult is it to get the right item ?? waited 3 days and had to be up early for the arrival of the parcel, only to be greeted with disappointment."
Purchased a polo waistcoat over Xmas at a very good price compared to other retailers and it arrived 5 days later very well packaged and in perfect condition. 5 star service !
Horrible company. I bought a gift card and used it on a purse that was then lost in transit. Now they refuse to give me any money back - I'm stuck with the stupid gift card to use on their terrible selection because the purse I originally bought is now out of stock.
After being refused a refund I emailed customer services and told them I was raising a dispute with PayPal. I received my refund within an hour. If using this company pay with PayPal.
Rubbish company who ask you to fill out a legal statement and then deny you a refund.I return 2 shirts and they said I return wrong items when I returned what I received.
"Initial sales and delivery process was good, with a nice UI, product range and layout. Product didn't fit right unfortunately so went to return and this is really where the experience went downhill.They received my return 2 days after I posted it and 18 days later I've heard nothing. Reached out via chat-bot and they told me they'd reach out to their warehouse and resolve when all of a sudden I was given an email to print & fill out a legal form with return tracking details, etc.I reached back out and the next person in the chat bot said they would help differently, but nope - still requiring me to fill out an antiquated form for which they already have all the information for.I filled it out (luckily I have Photoshop but no idea how some older or less IT literate folk would fare) and sent it back with no real idea of timescale for next steps. Worst part is, I have a gift-voucher so will have to buy from them again when credited the balance.Can draw your own conclusions as to why the process is like this but thought I'd share this experience and I'll keep to other eCommerce sites in the meantime, even if Zalando is cheaper."
Wished I’d had read these reviews before I ordered my daughter some crocs. Took the money over four weeks ago and was told item was posted. Tracked the item this week only to find it had been ‘lost in the post’. No apology just a promise to refund the money. Absolute disgrace and should be banned from trading.
"I have been a loyal customer of Zalando for years, I just wish I had read the reviews of them refusing refunds first. I returned an order using the label PROVIDED INSIDE THE PARCEL. I didn’t receive my refund so I provided them with the tracking number and they have said that it has been delivered back to Boohoo so will not refund me? I do not even shop at Boohoo and used the label they provided (it’s also worth mentioning they used to sell Boohoo items). I was getting no where by email so I called up asking for them to look into what has happened and why I have been given the wrong return label. The woman on the phone was extremely rude, refused to investigate and hung up on me! My bank ended up having to do a chargeback to receive my money back. Absolutely disgusting service. The fact they previously sold Boohoo makes you wonder if it is done purposely to refuse customers refunds looking at all of these other reviews of customers also being denied refunds. I will never shop here again."
"I recently ordered a Ralph Lauren jacket from Zalando UK last Saturday, primarily because I had some vouchers to redeem, and the price for the jacket was exceptionally attractive. However, my excitement quickly turned to concern when I decided to check out the Trustpilot reviews, which painted a rather grim picture of the company's services. At that point, I contemplated canceling my order, but to my surprise, the status had already changed to ""shipped.""The real surprise, however, came when my package arrived on the following Wednesday. The jacket was exactly as described on the website, and the overall shopping experience was quite seamless. Here's my detailed breakdown:Pros:Timely Delivery: Despite my initial reservations, the jacket arrived promptly within just a few days of placing my order. I was pleasantly surprised by the quick turnaround.Accurate Product Description: The jacket I received was in line with the product description on the Zalando UK website. It was genuine Ralph Lauren, well-packaged, and in perfect condition.Competitive Pricing: Zalando UK offered a fantastic price for the jacket, especially when compared to other retailers. The ability to use my vouchers made it even more affordable.Efficient Shipping Update: I appreciated the timely updates on the shipping status of my order, which kept me informed about the progress of my delivery.Cons:Trustpilot Reviews: My initial concerns stemmed from the overwhelmingly negative reviews on Trustpilot. It might be worthwhile for Zalando UK to address some of the issues raised by other customers and work on improving their customer service.Overall, my experience with Zalando UK was unexpectedly positive. Despite my reservations caused by Trustpilot reviews, they delivered the product promptly, and the item itself met my expectations. While it's essential to remain cautious when shopping online, my experience suggests that Zalando UK can provide a reliable service. However, they should focus on addressing the concerns raised by their customers to improve their overall reputation."
"Used this company alot. Probably given them far too much money over the years. However, cannot fault their service. Only ever had to return one item and had the refund within 3 days.Overall would shop from them again."
i ordered and wish i read the reviews. i sent them my package for refund and i was not issued one they told me that the box was empty. i was disappointed and reading these reviews makes me sure it was not a problem from my side. scamming company avoid them!!!!
Ordered a t-shirt on 26/12 and item has been with Evri “out for delivery” since the 4/1 and I still don’t have it. Will not purchase anything at Zalando again if they insist on using Evri….
"An absolute shambles of a company!Ordered a pair of slippers over the new year, when they arrived they were tiny on me. This is a manufacturing/size thing.I organised a return via Evri where the courier took 2 attempts to finally collect the parcel.I have left it a week and just put the tracking number into the Evri site, only to find out that the tracking number for the return is apparently invalid.I have contacted a Zalando representative who informed me that they would investigate. That their didn’t provide replacements, even though the slippers I originally bought at £32.50 are now £64.99, basically I have to pay twice the price and risk not ever getting my refund.I decided to save myself the risk of losing nearly £100 for a pair of slippers.The confusion I now have is how do I actually get my money back. Do I have to put a dispute in with my bank?An absolute shambles of a company. Very happy to scam people out of their hard earned money. I got off lightly, I hope people don’t lose large amounts of money to these con artists."
"Regular scam, happening to hundreds of people!  I sent an order back for £214. They received the parcel back but didn't send any correspondence. After chasing my refund, they refused to help me until I completed a legal document. After literally begging and chasing, zalando then informed me that my refund has been rejected because 'the item wasn't in the parcel' shocked and appalled, I immediately requested more information but they refuse to advise further.I have photographic proof I dropped my parcel to evri the parcel shop with the item inside but zalando refuse to refund me and now ignore my emails. Looking at Truspilot and Instagram, this is happening to numerous people worldwide! the issue / scam is far greater than it appears and it’s spreading by the day.It’s not safe to buy from this company! If you’ve had issues like this, it’s fraud. Please report to Action Fraud, citizens advise, trading standards and share your story on social media and Money Saving Expert"
"Appalling company!I’ve bought a Lacoste polo shirt on 11/12. They failed to deliver it on time for Christmas. I had no choice of courier company when I place my order and it went with EVRI. We all know this company has had massive issues with parcels lost and stolen. Zalando seems to know nothing about it. As soon as I realised it was shipped via Zalando I contacted their customer service. I was told by agents that I needed to be patient that they were plenty of time for my parcel to arrive for Christmas. Long story short still no parcel. Zalando is refusing to send me a replacement and failing to refund me. They are asking customers to fill out a “legal statement” with information they already have…also clearly EVRI tracking mentioned parcel is on its way… Impossible to get this sorted, no managers to talk to and customer service do not understand the concept of service recovery. Avoid at all cost! I had the same issue with La Redoute who were very quick to resend me my parcel…so it can be done!"
Absolute appalling.  Sent back a return for an exchange.  They have tried to keep my refund and ignore my concerns for over a month.  I will never use them again.
I have ordered 2 pairs of shoes for my children. I have not received the items even now. They were meant to be delivered since 21st Dec and today is 29th and still nothing came through. Dissapointment is an understatement.
"Where is my order??I ordered a pair of work shoes on 1st December, it is now 10th January and I am yet to receive them.  Zalando, never experienced problems before, what is happening???"
Used this online retailer so many times and returned unwanted items. Love it. Easy. Great prices. Thank you and wishing you all the success! Zane
"I ordered some shoes, which, after 2 weeks of regular wear, started to fall apart. i was totally disappointed and since on the website it said there was a 100 day return guarantee, i sent my shoes back. nowhere on their website did it say i had to send them an email of why i was returning, and nowhere on their website could i even see who i would contact to send such an email. they let me know that if i didn’t get back to them in 2 weeks, i would not get a return or the shoes back. i emailed them three times before i had had enough and had a friend call them, as i can’t speak German fluently and felt i wouldn’t be taken seriously if i spoke broken German. 15 minutes after the phone call, my refund was being processed. Terrible Terrible, lazy, deceptive customer service. they would have left my emails there unanswered until the time window was up and simply not given any compensation due to not receiving my emails in time, though they just hadn’t looked for them. whether it’s pure laziness or deception, i received a 10 percent off voucher for my inconvenience which i won’t be using as i’ll never buy from them again."
I placed an order 12th December hoping to receive it before Chrismas as this was a present. They said they dispatched to EVRI. The tracking says its still awaiting delivery.I contacted EVRI and gave me a case number. Still haven't heard from Them. Contacted Zalando by phone and they said they would contact EVRI. If Zalando never heard from EVRI by Boxing day them I would be issued with a refund.Contacted Zalando today 2nd January. Spoke to 2 advisors and they both cut me off even though I wasn't nasty to them. Before they cut me off they said they would send a form so they could contact EVRI on my behalf.One of them sent an email but said I need to print off form with my signature so they could contact EVRI.I am absolutely foaming at the mouth. All I want is a straight forward refund of £80 for the parcel I haven't recieved.DO NOT BUY FROM THEM.I wouldn't even give them a 1 star
"I wasn’t expecting to have a good experience given the terrible reviews but they were the only website to stock a hat that is now discontinued elsewhere. I accidentally ordered it three times as the website kept saying there was an issue with my transaction, but when I noticed and called customer service they cancelled two of the orders immediately without any hassle.The parcel arrived a few days later so I’m pleased!"
"Purchased from them many times , always quick delivery.  Returns are speedy and refunds prompt never had your issues."
"I was shocked to see many bad reviews for zalando. I’ve been using zalando for 8+ years, it’s my go to for clothe shopping. You can always find good discounts and the free delivery is fast. From air Jordan’s to carhartt this site is the one."
"The customer support is so bad!Lost my items in the post, couldn’t resend me the items! Then the live chat people were just disconnecting after I asked for a discount!Used this company for a long time but never again!"
"ZALANDO IS SCAM!!!! Like other reviewers, I really wished I had read these reviews before spending my hard earned money at Zalando. There seem to be a trend that returned parcel never arrives at their warehouse which is rather convenient and a big scam. I provided all the necessary evidence that my parcel was returned and the tracking shows it arrived safely at their warehouse, I was asked to sign a legal statement and send a redacted ID all of which was duly actioned. I sent tracking details and photos of package. They still state that they cannot process my refund.What more can I do, this is my worst experience of online shopping.I will not be pushed over or part with my money without a fight.Zalando do the needful and refund what you owe. Evri are very reliable and the tracker shows that you got the parcel back but do not want to refund the money back to your customers.I am £200 out of pocket due to your daylight robbery. Zalando must be brought to books.Like every other customers have mentioned, they simply say they can't process the refund without giving reasons or next steps. I can't believe this is allowed to happen in 2023.Scam! Scam!! Scam!!!If you value your money and sanity, please DO NOT shop at Zalando."
Ordered a pair of Nike Air Jordan's high top. Very pleased really efficient and reliable service as with every order before. Thank you!
I honestly think they are a scam company. Take peoples money earn interest on it for a month and then send you a refund. Ordered a coat Black Friday. Apparently it was lost in the post and couldn’t send another one despite it still being in stock! Avoid at all costs!!!!
"I returned an expensive leather jacket (strictly following Zalando's instructions) and never got a refund. Initially, they refused to refund the money by saying that the item never arrived to their warehouse. When I proved them wrong with the courier's tracking number, they admitted that it arrived a while ago. However, they asked me to fill in a legal document to get the refund. I was assured that I would get my money back as soon as I would send them such form. It did not happen, though. Instead, they said that they would need a copy of an ID document to finalise the process. Once I sent it, they said they will not refund the money because the leather jacket was not in the returned parcel. I was shocked! If that was the case, I do not understand why they did not say it in first instance. They make all sort of excuses so that refunds never go through. I used Zalando in the past in a different country and I was always happy with the service, so I trusted them blindly. Trustpilot reviews warn that it is almost impossible to get a refund from Zalando. I wish I had checked it before placing my order. I will never ever buy again from Zalando and I do not recommend purchasing from them at all."
I’ve bought from Zalando for a few years now. First heard about them as one of my boys was living in Berlin so was easy to shop online and send from local store. All products from them were great and if not my son sent back. No problems.I lost my Uggs recently and was so upset that I could not find a single pair anywhere online in January at all. Amazon sent one pair and I sent them back as could see they were not real. Zalando was literally the last place that had any and they arrived this week. There’s a qr hologram stitched inside which when scanned took me to the official store. Absolutely love them. They arrived one week from order!
"THIEVES AND SCAMMERS!!!! DO NOT ORDER FROM THEMFor Christmas I ordered my mother-in-law a wallet from MCM for 290€. I received the package on the 23rd and on the 24th of December when I went to wrap the present I quickly wanted to look inside of the MCM box to make sure there was no price tags on there. WHEN I OPENED THE BOX IT WAS EMPTYYYYY!!!! I straight away contacted Zalando's CS team and been fourth and back for almost 4 weeks and now they are telling me that they won't send me the wallet and won't refund me either. I am not a new customer and have ordered over them before... NEVER AGAIN, I'm going to go to the Police as this is THEFT!!!"
Placed an order on Boxing Day and it stated delivery will be between 30th Dec and 6th Jan. I was really pleased to receive my order today 31st Dec a lot sooner than expected. Thank you
"Zalando is one website , which really love it ! But there are some topics which they must refresh. First of all, they give you the choose to cancel your order in one hour, very important but you must wait for your refund 30 days. My opinion is that there isn’t reason to have this action. Similar companies have the same option but the refund is back the same moment if you cancel the next one hour. Also from my personal experience, I ordered one item and for one reason their system didn’t hold the number of my address. I sent to them one email and I feel that they are not sure if they can fix it. I mean that maybe the courier will been in my road , but he will not know the number. They answer me that if the courier will not find you, the parcel will come back to them. Yes I understand this, I don’t understand when I sent you email before the parcel is ready to start the process, I mean very very earlier and you tell me that you’re not sure if you can fix this detail. In the end, some customers service are very rude , like J.Btw I will continue to use this website because I believe that I must give one more chance."
"Will not refund me over £400 for the items I have sent back!!! I have order a couple of winter boots on sale, and sent 4 out 5 pairs back. I have proof of postage, and tracking, which I provided to them. They asked me to fill out a long legal form with all my details and send photo of my ID and then just said they will not refund me without any reason. AWFUL SCAM, AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!"
Attempted to return a parcel. Worst customer service I have ever seen - don't buy things unless you're absolutely certain you can keep them.
I saw a lot of bad reviews however my parcel came in 2 days of ordering and was in perfect condition. It also came with a return slip if I was to return it. Will use again.
"Ordered a pair of new balance trainers, item was better priced than other online retailers and came on time as described"
I bought the wrong size Koi for my niece and they were sold out everywhere. I found them on Zanlando and ordered them (7pm on 20th Dec) . Then I read the 1* reviews and panicked for days convinced I'd been scammed. They arrived on 24th! The box was a bit squished. They arrived a week before their due date. I would definitely order from this company again.
Cheap price and very quick delivery. I read the comments on trustpilot and gave it a go anyway and had a great experience
I have ordered a couple of shoes from zalando over the past yrs and never had any problem with this company thank God.Never had any problem with the return too.
"Reached out to their twitter team for help…….nothing, no reply, no assistance, nothing! Terrible customer service."
"I must admit, I very nearly didn’t order from Zalando due to the poor reviews. I found a jacket that I really liked from Lookiero but they didn’t have my size. When I saw it in Zalando for the same price I was massively deterred by the reviews. But it arrived quickly, with lots of Comms and all in good order. I will defo use again."
I have been purchasing from Zalando for many years and I’m shocked with the service I just received. I received my jacket and the seems on the front of the jacket is damaged. I spoke with a representative this morning and I asked if there was another one in stock of the same size as the jacket is quite nice and fits well. Representative via chat and they said whether i’d liketo keep the jacket and ask for partial refund/rebate or return it and get a full refund. I opted for rebate and submitted the claim with proof of damages. Only now to be told I should now return the item! As Zalando can’t source another for me and had obviously given me their last one that was damaged as it only put back to stock online tells me they didn’t cross check the condition of the restock/return before notifying me ‘item I want is back in stock’ email.Great shame as some time back i encountered the same issue and that was resolved positively whereas they offered a rebate/partial refund and kept that item but now they seem to send out defective items and force returns although proof of damages are submitted. Would have made sense if they had more in stock.After this return I will close my account.
The worse company I have ever used … for 20 parcels 12 was missing.. send back in parcel shop order for over 600£.. was missing too! Send them proof of sending items from parcel shop and official return form.. they said that they won’t give me my money back .. when I ask for the reason they don’t have answers.. also when I called  to customer service one guy was seatings in the room with child (becouse hear the noise )and he stop talking by the phone when my husband said that we will go to court with it.. call was continuing but that man didn’t say even one word.. second guy from customer service pick up phone and put it next by the radios and an other pick up and said that he can’t speak with me because have problem with internet.. it is a joke .. they still people money.. and they feel ok with it !!! See you in court!!!!
"Save your money and order elsewhere, zalando are known for not refunding money. They are an absolute nightmare to deal with"
"I returned the shoes on 19/01/2022, and till today, I haven't received a £120 refund. I'm pushed from person to person and from one form to another. People laugh on the other side of the line. No more shopping with them."
"Avoid avoid! Awful company- Refusing to refund my return. I wish I looked at the previous reviews before ordering. But I had used them before and had no issue. But this time I returned some dr marten boots of which I paid £128 at the beginning of December. I wasn’t hearing anything about my return, and the email I received confirming my return is on its way back to them said they are experiencing shipping delays etc. so I recently chased it and was told to fill out a form just as the other bad reviews explained. They then just said after investigating we have decided to not refund you because they received an empty box at the warehouse.  I have asked soo many times for a photo or some sort of proof and for someone to call me and I keep getting the same generic response-that I won’t be getting a refund as the box was empty. Evri have said the retailer needs to contact them, but they just don’t care.clearly one of their workers or someone stole them on route as based on the other bad reviews there is a trend. I am still in shock as this has never happened before, and I don’t understand what I cousin of done more to avoid it as I used their return label. Something odd is definitely going on and they don’t care at all, they just keep ignoring my emails and when I tried to speak to them on chat they again just kept avoiding my questions and repeating themselves"
"These company is mad. I wanted to change size of an item but it's impossible you need to return it and place a new order. After I done that they lost my parcel, they did not resend it as out of stock."
"I wish to God I read these reviews before ordering from Zalando!!! Returned a £130 pair of boots and no refund!! Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!!!"
"Very poorDelivery failed to a Tesco pick up point waited 8 days ,then told wont get a refund for 24 days after the item is returned to them ... shockingly bad service"
"Took my money and website took me back to the page showing the item still in my basket asking me to pay again. I’ve chased them but have been ignored, I have had to go to PayPal to get my money back. Do not use!!!"
Really poor web-site impossible to register an account - don't waste your time.
"They sell fake stuff, bought some Nike blazers for £67 pounds came in the wrong colour and so obviously fake."
Never received my order. Can't get refund just being handled for weeks now.
"Horrible! Their partner itella is not delivering the order and are even lying. The order is late, customer service from itella unresposnsive. Zalando customer service cannot help"
"I brough a jacket from Zalando which was reduced in the sale at the time. Unfortunately, when it arrived it was too large. In the meantime the jacket had also gone back up to full price so I emailed them to ask if they could exchange it for a smaller size, which for any reputable company is fairly straight forward.However, I received an email back saying that they don’t do exchanges but if I returned the original and ordered the correct size, when they received the original they would refund the difference, which although very odd I agreed too.On this basis I reordered the jacket (different colour but same price) only to be told that they couldn’t offer the original price as it was a different colour and needed to be the same to which I replied that it was fine and requested that they just sent the smaller size in the same colour.Since then, they have sent numerous emails now changing their minds and refusing to match the original purchase price so having now returned the original and cancelled the second order I am now £509 out of pocket without any coats.To make matters worse this is not our first bad experience with Zalando’s terrible customer service. Having previously purchased another coat from them it arrived with split seams. I subsequently emailed them with photo’s and asked if they could replace the coat as it had arrived damaged. Out of no where a 50% refund then appeared in our account without them even having the decency to respond to my email to explain why.Awful company and we certainly won’t be making the same mistake again and will be avoiding them at all costs from now on."
"Zalando is a great online shopping platform with a wide variety of products, competitive prices, and exceptional customer service. They offer free shipping, a Prime membership, and a user-friendly interface. Their return policy is accommodating, making the shopping experience stress-free. Overall, I highly recommend Zalando for convenient and reliable online shopping."
"I ordered some boots from this piece of trash of a company... Well my experience...Estimated delivery was 3-5 days. After 2 and a half weeks I got my order finally.Tried it on (in my home, not outside) and decided that it didn't fit too well. ""Happens a lot probably with online shopping for clothes, thankfully they have a return possibility"" I thought. Oh boy was I wrong...My living room, is not the most clean and I have a dog too, so some specks of sand on the floor and dog hair are nothing out of the ordinary. The boots did collect a little bit of dust on the soles (bottom) but I cleaned it off as well as possible and packaged the product for the return shipment. I think its worth mentioning that the box the boots came in was in terrible shape. It had a hole in it and some bruises. There was no padding around the product box. So packaging is 0/10.Anyway... After returning the product I got an e-mail a week and a half later. They told me it was not possible to refund. I then proceeded to ask, why exactly. They told me that it was a used pair of boots. Then as I explained (at this moment in a calm manner) that it was tried on inside on a wooden floor with some dust for the grand total of 5-10 minutes, they still refused to refund my money.So the moral of the story is: shipping time way longer than it was advertised; packaging is terrible also, with no protective foam or anything and if you try on something for 5 mins, you can not return it anymore.I would personally advise not buying anything from this firm, if you are not sure it will be perfect for you, since there is a clear NO RETURN-policy and they are just fake advertising that there would be.If you still decide to take a chance, I would say, don't buy anything that is too valuable, because that money is gone forever. I learned my lesson the hard and way too expensive way about this shady trash company. Learn from my mistakes.I gave 1 star since 0 was not an option."
Received shoes quickly. Didn't fit so sent back for a refund that was in my bank within 5 days.
thank you very much i am very satisfied and it is really a reliable site
"I recently had a second disappointing experience with Zalando when they failed to send me the product I had ordered or lost it somewhere in transit. Despite multiple attempts to reach out to customer service, I was unable to get any clear answers or resolution to the issue.Not only was this experience frustrating and time-consuming, but it also left me feeling incredibly let down by the company's lack of accountability and follow-through. While I understand that shipping and delivery issues can arise, it's concerning to me that Zalando seemed so indifferent to my situation and unwilling to take any meaningful steps to make things right.Based on my experience, I would caution others against doing business with Zalando and suggest looking for alternatives that prioritize customer satisfaction and timely delivery."""
"I ordered a pair of trainers on 31/12/22. It said they would be delivered between 5-10/1/23. It is 11/1/23 and they have not been delivered. I contacted Zalando who said their logistics partner, Evri, had lost them. They said they could refund me for the trainers if I completed a legal statement delivery form as they needed to make a claim against Evri. I've never heard of such things. Zalando said it was their policy and when I asked to be directed to it they said it was an internal policy only. The fact is my contract of sale is with Zalando. I've paid for goods I have not received so they are legally obliged to refund me, regardless of whether they have a successful claim against Evri for not delivering the goods. I reluctantly completed the form due to their insistence but they need to change their internal policies. Holding back a refund to a customer when goods have been paid for and not delivered is a breach of the contract of sale. Zalando need to be careful!UPDATE: 23/1/23I have been refunded for the trainers I ordered above. However, the original trainers I bought on 24/12/22 were returned on 2/1/23 as they were the wrong size, hence my second order above. The return never made it back to the Zalando warehouse (lost by Evri again!). I was asked to complete a legal statement return this time and include proof of postage, which I did, but they are now refusing to refund me. I have spoken to numerous different people on the phone today who say there is nothing they can do as it has been investigated and this is 'what they have decided'. It will suffice to say I will not buy anything from Zalando again! The 100-day free return policy means absolutely nothing!ANOTHER UPDATE: 6/2/23I raised a transaction dispute with my credit card provider by completing a claim form and presented all the evidence I had. Thankfully, the dispute was successful so I received a chargeback.Even though this was the outcome I was hoping for, it should not have come to this and any respectable company would have dealt with this professionally. As I said earlier, I will never buy from Zalando again and would very strongly recommend you don't either. If you are willing to take the risk use a credit card to increase your chances of getting a refund if you need to return anything.The positive reviews are either Zalando employees or people paid to write positive reviews among all the negative ones."
Used a number of times now and happy with each order.Good priced items and smooth and easy process
"Previously, I have procured goods from Zalando in countries such as Poland and Germany, and have not encountered any issues when utilizing their provided courier services, such as DPD and DHL, to return items. As such, upon relocating to the United Kingdom, I trusted in their reputation as a credible company and purchased several items from them. However, upon returning said items through Evri, I have not received the corresponding refund. Despite my numerous attempts to rectify the situation through various means, such as sending legal forms and citing relevant legal statutes indicating their obligation to refund my payment of £140 (a significant amount for a university student), Zalando has refused to provide the refund, citing that they cannot locate the parcels and have not been returned to their warehouse. This issue has persisted for several months, with Zalando ceasing all communication and providing no means of contact on their website, including email or phone numbers. Evri even though I have receipts of previously tracing the parcels now does not recognize the tracking numbers I was given. Such actions are reprehensible and unjust, as it entails taking the funds of unsuspecting individuals and never providing them with the return they deserve, either through utilizing courier providers who mishandle or lose parcels or through keeping the proceeds for themselves.m."
Product never arrived. They lost the parcel and no longer have my size. Unless
Stole money from my bank account with unauthorised transactions. Fraud company criminals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Amazing arrived on time as promised.  Quality excellent,  sizing excellent.  Thank you!"
Item not turned up. Live chat rubbish and no apology
Amazing shop! 10/10
They gave me the wrong order twice!Can’t trust these people
"Fab clothes, prices and service."
Scammers. Scammers. Scammers.
"Was really dubious about ordering due to the sheer amount of negative reviews, but I'd found a pair of crocs that my daughter would fall in love with for Christmas so I bit the bullet and ordered them. They arrived after a few days via Evri which shocked me as I'd convinced myself they weren't going to come! Sorry for doubting you Zalando I will be ordering again!"
lost my items and wont re send the order. wont use them again
"AVOID THIS COMPANY !   Looks to be a scam company, ordered an item they said would take 2 days - 3 weeks later still not arrived, when I contacted them they said they hadn't taken payment when they had etc..  Customer service just tell you to wait 24hrs then they say wait another 7 days - the company doesn't look to have any stock hence all the problems people are seeing in the reviews as they quote great prices but can't deliver the end product."
1 word: YodelActually they took over 4 days just to dispatch my items before Yodel would lost them completely...
This company is a scam!!.I returned an item on the 27.11.22 and I am still waiting for a refund. They have acknowledged receipt but the refund is still pending. I don't understand why a refund process should take this long!!!. Please avoid them by all means
This company is horrendous to deal withRubbish updates and couriers are a jokeAvoid ordering anything!!!!!!
AVOID USING THEM! Whilst you might want to order THEY USE EVRI!! Good luck to receiving you parcel without tearing your hair out!!
Disgusting company absolute scam please read reviews before you purchase. Not even worth the hassle sent wrong items and refused refund even tho all correct information sent and item returned.
"Absolute sham & joke of a company. Placed order on the 1st of December & paid for 48 hour tracked delivery.. fast forward to today 17/12/22) & my parcel has been “sent out for delivery” and returned to the depot 5 times. Wake up today to find out it’s been returned to sender. Now this is where Zalando come in, Jesus Christ it’s so obvious they are reading from a script with the same crappy response everytime. Within the space of 10 seconds I was told that I didn’t have my parcel because they tried to deliver at 9:09am which then changed to I didn’t receive it because they were told I’d moved address which is a lot of BS, who could’ve even told them that?? I was then told that I need to wait an extra 14 days, print out a form, fill it out then send it back first class & wait to find out if I’m even ELIGIBLE for a refund.. £125 down the drain for nothing, will now need to take this up with my bank. If you are thinking of using this company I cannot stress enough DO NOT DO IT. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, I am now of the opinion that this website & their employees are scammers. Absolutely fuming."
Only giving them a 1 star as I have to as a minimum. My order has got lost and is now 2 weeks over due. Contacted Zalando on the live chat and they can’t figure out where my order is. They are also refusing to give me a refund so I can order elsewhere. After notifying them 3 days ago and giving them the 48hrs required to track/trace my order they are non the wiser and still refuse to give me my refund. I don’t have any confidence in getting my order or my refund back of this company and I can do very little about it as they simply don’t care. Very suspicious & dodgy company. Please avoid at all costs.
"I should of read the reviews , my parcel has been with evri since the 5th and they keep asking me to wait and offering me 10% on next order there wont be any next order because the customer service is silly, better off ordering from another country or making the trainers myself thats how long its taken."
"Evri lost/stole the parcel. After so many days still waiting to be resolved. No shoes, no money. CS slow and Evri even slower. Companies should start avoiding Evri and I believe every customer would pay extra for shipping, and knowing they will actually get their order. I’m not even gonna get my refund nor shoes by next year. Filled out the form I was given twice. Next step is to go to the bank"
"I am extremely satisfied. Their customer service is amazing, quick replies and very helpful both via emails or chat. I ordered a coat and contacted customer service for a price match + an exchange. They were super helpful, kept their promises. Fast delivery. I will keep ordering from them. It's one of the most reliable websites you'll ever come across."
"After reading the reviews (after I had already made a purchase) I was in total panic. Overall I was VERY impressed. The delivery was on time.The online chat option  was very useful amd staff were more than willing to answer any queries I had. I received the right order, perfectly packaged"
"First and last time ordering from here, evri lost parcel, but these guys telling me to wait 10 more days, basically refusing to refund...Not acceptable at allMeanwhile my girlfriend getting hers parcels to the same adress...And tracking clearly showing that it has been lost...Just wooow customer service, stay away people"
My parcel got lost somewhere in the system by Evri. After some difficulty I managed to contact Zolando via their chat line. Grace Kaludo was extremely helpful and managed to get a refund for after many frustrating days. I can now order again and hope that evri deliver!
Customer service is really poor. Their deliveries are incredibly late but they don't want to refund you. Avoid at all costs!
"I spoke on the phone with customer service about cancelling an order I thought I wouldn't be at home to receive due to seasonal delays. He said I should hear back within 48 hours. As it turned out I received an email that same afternoon, which was surprising.Having dealt with a fair few company's customer service (including like 5 in the past month or so) I've come to expect to wait anywhere between 2-5 days for a response- with the same wait for each subsequent reply- at this time of year.But Zalando got back to me in a few hours, and managed each subsequent reply within a few minutes. Quite impressive compared to the other companies I've dealt with."
Never delivered Item. Claim it was lost by courier. I had to chase this up after two weeks. Very poor experience.
"everything has gone wrong. ordered a parcel on 23/11. still not arrived, no update to tracking in 2 weeks. I understand with Christmas, there is an increased level of parcels but this doesn't excuse zalandos terrible customer service. absolutely awful. they don't care, reply with the same scrawl every reply, constantly dismissing queries. honestly feels like your talking to an automated system. I have been passed from pillar to post, had no reassurance or guarantee that my parcel will ever arrive and have spoke to around 10 different people, all are useless. I could go on for days, it has made me so angry, I would strongly discourage anyone from ordering through this site."
I bought a pair of nike sb premium navy’s and when they arrived they had a little cut in one of the shoe laces and some of the white stitching going over the orange nike logo. I don’t know much about shoes and if it’s supposed to be like that.
I ordered from them in November they have told me Evri messed up the order! I spoke to Zalando customer services 3 times about the situation & they guaranteed I would receive it by Friday 16.12.22. Today they have refunded me because the item was returned & yet it was NEVER delivered by Evri. I spoke to the Zalando customer service Manager who could not even finish his conversation with me & passed me back to his customer service operator!!  I would not even give them 1 star but you have to to write a review!! They told me I had to order the item again & the price may have increased!!!  Can you believe it!?  Don’t buy from them they are charlatans. They don’t know their left from their right.
"Bought a pair of Salomon trainers that had colour scuff off the toe on the first time I wore them. Zalando does not offer exchanges so tried to get me to send them back to verify the defect. When I asked customer service what would happen once verified I was told I would get a refund but as it was a black friday offer this would mean I would have to pay more to replace them.The customer service agent I spoke to said that I must have been offered a partial refund to keep the item or a full refund to send it back but I was not, I was only asked to send it back to be verified. When i asked him why i was not offered this he backtracked and said this is their policy and I'll only be given a refund to return the item.Overall, disappointed with how this was handled. My partner had a similar issue with the same brand of shoes but purchased with another retailer was given a full refund + was able to keep them. Zalando is just trying to force me to keep them because they know I won't be able to replace for the same price I paid originally."
One star is too much. I returned an item in august and it got lost in transit using zalando returns label. UPS have also confirmed to me that the goods have gone missing and all zalando need to do is raise a dispute and they will be reimbursed and can then refund me. Zalando are refusing to raise a dispute and refusing to even acknowledge me anymore and just sent me the same automatic message each time. This company is a scam they have kept my money for an item I returned which cost me £79. Avoid Avoid Avoid Avoid Avoid. Scam Scam Scam!!!!!
Returned item and 2 days later received refund. Never had any issues with this company. Fabulous service. Thank you.
"It was a very disappointing experience with Zalando, I am furious and patient with them for my refund, order was placed in October and returned but there is no response for my return, I am contacting every time and same bulshit response from their team, they’re getting paid for free basically and not doing properly job"
"I’m not sure what happened with this company.I ordered two items, waited for my parcels to arrive. Nothing happened, I contacted customer service just to find out Evri lost them.I’m still waiting for my refund.I will not order again."
"Please don’t shop from Zalando. It’s not worth the money you are saving buying from a different website.I was supposed to receive a parcel on 3rd December. Now being the 10th December I still have not received the parcel and Zalando customer service has not been able to help me although I spoke to 7 different members of staff. I therefore asked for a refund and being told the process to accept the refund will take another 72 hours!!! Zalando is a scam, please avoid buying from this website as the customer service is absolutely awful"
"Appalling service to say the least... Asked for a returns collection on Friday, no one showed up to collect... Contacted Zalando to sort it out for another collection, and they gave me the excuse it's because it's Christmas (which is a whole load of bs, as I had issue before in August!).The lady I spoke to didn't even bother asking me which day would be more convenient for another collection attempt, just said it would be rebooked and left the chat....Contacted a second time... and again, same thing happened... Asked them to stay in the chat until I received a confirmation email for a second rebooking, and they just left!Zalando, you just lost yourself a customer!EDIT: The courier just showed up at my doorstep 1 day later and after my complain as I was leaving the house to go shopping... no excuse given to not collecting the parcel yesterday!I booked it for Friday for a reason, don't show up at my doorstep as you please as I will not be home!"
"Have used Zalando previously without any issue, placed an order 2 weeks ago, quickly got a text from Yodel who advised they were waiting for parcel, another email a few days later advising at the local delivery depot, still showing its at delivery depot 4 days later, and no information on delivery date, contacted zalando who issued refund via PayPal, however I was expecting to receive the parcel as it was a gift, very disappointing, I don’t think the parcel was ever sent by Zalando, I think they create tracking numbers and generate them to the courier to make it look like they have shipped the parcel, but don’t! Contacted yodel who have no clue what’s going on. Avoid!"
I’ve been shopping at Zalando for many years and it’s always so reliable. They have a great variety of brands and clothing items with a selection of premium brands as well. Excellent customer service and they make it so easy with free collection of your returns.
"I tried to order a bomber jacket in a size that was out of stock so filled in the"" notify me when in stock "" .  Literally within an hour I received an email saying it was in stock, but when I followed the link to the site, it still was not in stock.  So phoned customer service..OMG they are AWFUL! the first guy kept asking me for my order number, I said I had not placed an order, he did not understand what I was saying...so he placed me in a queue and never came back to me.  So I kept phoning and they kept putting phone down on me.  Eventually I spoke to another person who again was asking me for my details so she could look at my account..Again I said I haven't even got one yet as I can't place an order.  Explained what I was trying to do and told her I had an email saying it was back in stock.  She checked and said it wasn't, I asked why I had an email and she said it probably was in stock but went out of stock straight away..I said "" what in 10 mins????""   Very rude company, totally useless customer service...and then I decided to look on Trust Pilot and low and behold I find its best to avoid them.  I wished I had read the reviews first before trying to order with them.  AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!"
"Absolute joke of a company, my parcel was delivered and left on my doorstep by the courier whilst I was at work, when I returned it was not there so immediately contacted them to advise and also the delivery company. It’s 4 weeks on and still haven’t received a refund, I’ve had to send a legal statement and a copy of my driving licence, they’re still investigating apparently. Never been so stressed 😩"
"Really poor customer service, why they continue using Evri to deliver I do not understand. Might be cheaper but will lose them custom. I will now never purchase from zalando again. I’m spreading the word, large family have now been warned and will also not use. Up there with worst cust service to date, some achievement"
"Most horrible shopping experience.When buying I signed up to returns policy that allowes the returns to be collected from home. But what a “surprise” Their courier Evri is the biggest scam on earth! I tried to arrange NINE collections and every time the driver wouldn’t show up, I did not even get an explanation why. Imagine how much time and effort it took, to go through arranging the collection, waiting for it to take place and staying at home the whole day waiting for the driver, realizing that the driver will not show up, contacting Zalando, deaing with their staff who don’t keep track of theor records, arranging another collection… .. Evri doesnt even have Zalando on their website listed as a retailer that they work with, so you can’t deal with them directly - you have to go via Zalando customer service who is useless and can’t keep track even of their own communications.I will never ever shop with Zalando again. Such a rubbish company.I want my money back!!!!"
Awful! Will be contacting ombudsman’s
"The worst experience shopping I have ever had, ordered online and 1 week later advising return had been received, I had not received item let alone returned it. Contact customer service, Karen was the rudest I have spoke to in my life - cut me off the chat as ‘had already spoke to me once and couldn’t resolve the issue’. Item is in stock on website at much higher price now. I believe this is a breach of contact and they didn’t want to deliver the item at price paid. Will be contacting ombudsman! Avoid"
After reading the bad reviews I was very sceptical of ordering (and very nearly didn't). However I went for it (as the price was great) and glad I did. Ordered two products (separate orders) to the UK and both arrived with no problems.
Item recieved quicklyGood service all round
I can never seem to receive my parcels as they use the worst couriers to deliver items. Both of my deliveries 2 weeks apart have still not been delivered or lost. Which makes me think these courier drivers are stealing these items and Zalando are not doing anything about it. All they do is offer a refund and discount of 15% for it to just happen again anyways.
Package with courier. Package did not arrive. I call Zalando (6 days after delivery date) and the package has been lost. Who was going to tell me???? Nobody. Avoid EVRI and ZALANDO
I have been ordering from Zalando for years and never had any issues. Unfortunately I had less luck with my last two orders from Zalando Partner Massimo Dutti! I'm waiting 3 weeks to get refund of over £300... I'm concerned if ever received my money back.
My order never turned up. I first raised the issue with Evri. They confirmed that they could not locate the parcel and I should contact Zalando. After a month I got a response to say no refund as the carrier confirmed it was delivered
"Returned an item for a refund, no refund received - reached out to them via email and they're saying it's already been processed, even though I've not had any money back. Still expecting £17.99 back and nothing received"
"I ordered a belt and I got advise from Zalando's customer service regarding the size. It turned out that the size that I was advised was way too small. So I started the return process. I reordered the item with the correct size and paid again. 10 days I am waiting EVRI to collect my return and to get refunded, but nothing happens. I sent several emails to Zalando and they send me back automated replies, apologising that my initial collection didn't take place. They rearrange the collection over and over and I am still waiting for Evri to pick it up. EVRI is the most incompetent delivery service and that's the reason that I will never use Zalando unless they change provider."
"Right after receiving an order, I noticed that some items were massively reduced. Upon my question to refund the price difference, in order to avoid returning and reordering the items, I received a negative reply. What is the point in polluting the environment more than necessary?Also, chase up on your refunds, they take forever and you will never receive your money, if you don't keep chasing for it."
"It can be clearly seen that my order wasn't delivered both on the Zalando orders page and on stupid EVRI tracking page - but I still need to print a form and sign it manually for ""lovely"" Zalando to process a refund. WHY do I need to deal with forms if it can be clearly seen that I didn't get the order?"
"Hesitant initially due to the reviews however I can't fault the service.. great price football boots, no issues wse.. delivered promptly. Customer service live chat efficient and helpful. Will be coming back.."
Not the first time that my items are not delivered they make you wait weeks then send you a refundCustomer service very rudeThey end the chat when you ask about the updatesNot recommended at all
"I don't know what happend to this company but it because horrible.  Stolen packages, booked money from canceled orders,employees who offend you are rude like customer service treats clients as they are some Boss, they never reply otherwise. Is terrible. I called the police to get my money back one and I will do it again. After that I am done with them. And the ones who wrote 5 starts even are part of them or was a case trust me.ps: is about zalando at/de"
Account deactivated due to being breached and someone changed my address and billing details. I only realised after I purchased my order on 28/011/22 and checking my account today and noticed the change of details which is a clear breach of my DPA. They could not give me any details of when my account details were changed so were extremely unhelpful. I paid via PayPal so this should have been picked up via Zalando systems but it wasn't. I originally purchased several items from Zalando on black Friday and Zalando deactivated my account without any investigation or answers to how my details got changed without my knowledge or what will happen with my order as they cancelled it. I asked if I would receive the same discount as I was told I have to make a new account with a new email and reorder my items. The customer service advisor said I can't get the same discount and I would not recieve a voucher or discount code so I can reorder these items at the same price I originally purchased them before Zalando cancelled my order without my authorization. Extremely poor customer service and the fact I've seen comments giving other customers who've experienced a bad  service receive vouchers so they are treating me different to other  customers and I'm disgusted at the service as I've spent thousands over the years with Zalando and have been shown no appreciation for my loyalty. I've subsequently written a formal complaint to Zalando and am awaiting a response from a manager to explain their actions
The worst customer service i have EVER received. Ordered an item wrong one turned up. Spoke to two ladies who didn’t know what they were talking about. Sent item back for refund and they are now not giving me a refund as they have received the wrong item back that THEY sent me. DO NOT ORDER FROM ZALANDO
"Honestly, one of the worst shopping experiences of my life! Sent me the wrong shoes twice and expected me to make 3rd order. No way! Customer service useless. Warehouse useless. Will never shop with them again and I advise others to avoid. As an apology they give you a discount code for future orders. I burst out laughing when I seen that. I would have to lose my mind before I ordered from them again. Tattie Bye Zalando"
"Was worried about ordering with all the negative reviews on here , but apart from my delivery being a couple of days late ( which I think was down to the courier service used ) everything was else is great - trainers were a saving of nearly 50% .Will order again ."
I came across Zalando on Black Friday having never heard of or used before.  I was a little nervous but had not need to worry.  The item turned up package perfectly and I couldnt be happier.  I would consider using them again for sure.
"I ordered a pair of Nike A270 trainers last week as the price on this website was so much cheaper than any other I could find. I was quite sceptical after reading some negative reviews and decided to pay via paypal after reading someone advise to do this in case all went wrong. The service from start to finish has been 5 star - exactly how you hope online ordering to be. I was kept up to date on how my order was progressing and given a date for delivery within the original timeframe. Trainers were delivered, packaged perfectly and all as expected. Will use again."
"Recently ordered a pair of shoes - completety wrong colour way and description of item!when calling the customer service department, I spoke to Valentina who was no help what so ever!such poor suctomer serivce from zalando"
AVOID! SELLING FAKES! Bought my boyfriend an AllSaints shirt that was around £70. Received it today for them to have sent a cheap Jack Jones shirt with an AllSaints label attached to it! The label was even in Chinese so was clearly a fake! Don’t know whether to laugh or cry!
Still waiting on my delivery that has now gone past its estimated delivery date. Keep getting update on the way then suddenly getting an update sorry we need more time. Spend over £200 and for what. Going abroad in few days will have to arrive empty handed at this rate without the gifts for my family
I was worried about my order as it was a little late so I checked the reviews online which seemed awfulI emailed Zalando to see where my order was and they replied in under a hour!!! My order turned up a couple of days late but my shoes were a absolute bargain and I found the customer service to be spot onDon’t be put of by the negative reviews I will be ordering from these guys again for sure great prices great customer service
"Whatever this company used to be it’s now gone down the toilet. They are refusing to refund me for returned items, giving different reasons each time I email them. Hundreds of people are being scammed by them on undelivered items (which they blame on the courier) or refusing to refund returned items. Do not buy from them you will NEVER get your money back!!"
I ordered an item (it was a gift!) with the black Friday sales. They use Evri as a courier and of course the item was lost. I had to contact customer service twice to understand what was happening to my order. Suddenly I receive an email saying that they refunded me the amount. I never asked for a refund and requested for a replacement item to be sent. Customer service state that they cannot do that and I have to place another order. Of course now there is no longer a discount available and they want me to pay more. They then offer to contact them again for a price match AFTER I will receive the order. This is absolutely ridiculous. Very poor customer service as they do not care at all. Make yourself a favor and order somewhere else!
"Do not order from zalando! I bought a pair of slippers £69.99,using paypal,had to return as not suitable on the 17th october, i have had no money back yet and does not look as if i am getting my full refund as paypal has closed my case against zalando as paypal does not cover the payments to them.Purchase elsewhere!!!! Rip off zalando!!"
I was nervous to purchase with this company but item arrive. The only thing is the lack of communication by company to let you know the progress and acknowledgement of purchase.
"Still waiting for item, over a week since ordering. Not a total shock as they use Evri who are consistently hopeless. Awaiting an update on what is happening. I won’t order again while they use Evri. Hopefully they can resolve quickly without the need for a chargeback."
"I ordered 2 pairs of infant trainers and an outfit, it took 6 days to reach me with Evri tracking (not too bad given the time of year!) and everything arrived perfectly. Really happy with my experience. I'll be shopping with Zalando again."
"The item was not delivered to me despite the standard shipping charge on top of the product's price. After repeatedly contacting the Zalando team to find out where my order was, I finally got a refund.Interestingly various people from the team provided multiple responses to my query for a refund showing a communication gap between them:a) The first person (who I contacted via chat) told me that although my item was one week delayed, I needed to receive it first and then return it to Zalando and ask for a refund.b) The second person (who I contacted via chat) informed me that the item was lost and released a refund straight away.c) The third person (who I contacted via email) took the longest to respond to my query and informed me that the item is on its way and should arrive soon(!)-> which never happened.I am glad I was so persistent, as at least I managed to get a refund. Unfortunately, I never received the item, which was a birthday present.The overall process was so stressful that I am not going to shop from Zalando again."
I do not understand all the negative reviews as I bought an item and received it within 4 days with absolutely no problem at all and I will definitely be using Zalando again in the future.
"I have purchased from Zalando 3 times, and I have never had any issues. This current purchase resulted in a return, and it was a quick refund back into my account. Zalando have great items and great prices, don't be put off by the negative reviews"
have failed to respond to our request for replacement itemno obvious way to complain so customer service very poor
Please don't buy from this company.I ordered a pair of trainers which were too small.I returned them and over 3 weeks later I'm still waiting on a refund.
Why do your customer service team not deal with complaints I have asked on 4 occasions for my complaint to be escalated and they avoid answering and send me a standard non relevant reply 😡
I used Zalando for an item more expensive than ASOS because Zalando stated delivery 2-5 days with Royal Mail and ASOS use EVRi who are the worst most appalling courier in the UK and shouldn’t be in business. Today I have notification EVRi have my parcel from Zalando with minimum 10 day delivery (last EVRi delivery took 5 weeks after apparently a ‘disruption’!!) Disgusting service and now I may never get the order and I paid more thinking they didn’t use EVRi. All companies using EVRi should clearly state this then their business would drop! Won’t ever use Zalando again steer clear!
"This was my first time making a purchase from the Zalando and honestly like most people on here, I was very hesitant to do due to less than pleasant reviews on here. I had to mull over my initial purchase for a few weeks before eventually caving in and making the purchase. I was quite happy with the service updates and my delivery was very prompt. It took at least 3 working days for me to receive my purchase. I'm soo happy that I caved in because I paid 60% for boots that cost a fortune elsewhere."
Can't get a refund. Been over 3 weeks and I keep getting fobbed off with excuse after excuse. Avoid this company at all costs.
My parcel arrived damaged and items missing. Contacted them straight away and filled a form out. I have spoken to several people supposedly they’re really bad customer service regarding my refund. It’s been over a month and going on since October still not had my money back they keep fobbing me off telling me to check my back account. I have and there’s no bloody money!!!Anyone wishing to purchase from this company don’t bother there a bunch of crooks!!!!!
"AVOID THIS COMPANY!!! LOST PARCEL TWICE WITHIN 2 WEEKS TIME! I have ordered a pair of shoes for my little boy first time, use the worst delivery company EVRI, which changed name but still same terrible delivery service. I originally purchased with a gift card. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and the second time I order, there again your order has been delayed. The horrible customer service they offer you no one contacts you to let you know what is happening. So i called them so many times. No one could tell me. So I said just refund me on a gift card as paid with it fair e ough. NO THEY SAID has to put on your account. I certainly don't want to order again from the UK website!! So they don't allow me to order from another country to be delivered in that country which at least don t use EVRI!! AVOID AT ALL COST"
I have to say I was a bit nervous ordering from this company after reading the reviews on trust pilot. I decided to order as the price was really good. I ordered a hoody age 14 to 16 and recieved the item in two days of ordering. The item was very small in size and I needed to return the item but it was a lovely sweater and good quality. I even recieved a free return label in my parcel if I needed to return. I returned the sweater and recieved a full refund within 3 days. I needed to write this review as there was quite a lot bad reviews but my experience was a very good one.
"I almost didn't buy from this company as the reviews weren't great but my order arrived within days and was exactly what I ordered, at the cheapest price I found online! Would personally use again"
"This is the worst experience I ever had in my life. I am waiting over a MONTH to sort out a return label. When I collected my parcel, Evri (Hermes) didn’t scanned the barcode and ZALANDO does not understand that, every time they send me a return label I am not able to return it as they can’t scan it. I have sent over a 10 emails in total, no response, chat is useless… I hear the same thing over the phone WE TRY TO FIX IT, and they blame SUPERDRY for this… I am still waiting for solution and my money, but they ignore me and I can’t get my refund! How this is even possible? That big company?! This will be raised with some government agencies, as I have enough of this. Don’t buy anything from them! This is no the first time when I experience unprofessional, useless service. Never again."
"This is my first time shopping in Zalando. Before I decided to check out, I checked the comments here and saw there are a lot of bad experience. I finally decided to try and use PayPal as payment method as I can dispute the payment if the goods do not arrive.I ordered it on Sunday and received my item on Wednesday, packed nicely. I can't be more happier.I do not write review often but think I should share my experience here."
"Have been using Zalando for over 7 years with no problems. Recently I've purchased a £200 jacket. Unfortunately it didn't fit me well therefore sent back for a refund. It's been two and a half weeks and the customer service keeps telling that the warehouse still processing my return. From what I can see, a lot of people are facing very similar problem recently. Really not happy :(Update : got my money back . Opened dispute through PayPal ."
"Zalando used to have great customer service, but they have totally reversed. I didn't receive my item, provided carrier proof that it was returned back to Zalando and after a month they still refuse a refund. Disgraceful."
"I ordered a coat, which didn't suit me and I had to return it. The return was processed and I dropped the parcel at the local drop point but not delivered by the courier who 'lost' the parcel. Tracking clearly shows not delivered, yet despite this Zalando has refused to help or offer a refund. I provided all proof, legal statement and I receive snotty email from customer service that is not willing to help at all! The fact that they know they are breaking the law and they still treat the customers like that is beyond me.If you want a peaceful life and normal( not even excellent) customer service keep away from this company!Have had to contact my bank in the end to raise a dispute and get my money back that way.AVOID AVOID AVOID"
"Ordered some trainers, which I never received.  They were dispatched but not delivered by the courier who 'lost' the parcel.  Tracking clearly shows not delivered, yet despite this Zalanda has refused to help or offer a refund, happy to take my money and not bothered in the slightest that I did not get my item,   Customer service dreadful.Have had to contact my bank in the end to raise a dispute and get my money back that way.AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS"
"HORRENDOUS COMPANY WE SENT OUR ITEMS BACK FOR A REFUND NEARLY A MONTH AGO AND THEYVE MADE US JUMP THROUGH MANY HOOPS PROOF OF RETURN ASKED FOR WHICH WE GAVE THEM IMMEDIATELY WHICH SHOWS ITEMS HAVE BEEN RETURNED AND RECEIVED, THEN THEY WANTED A LEGAL STATEMENT COMPLETED ITEMISING EACH ITEM, THEN THEY WANTED ID TO PROVE IT WAS ME EVEN THOUGH THE REFUND WOULD GO BACK ON TO THE CARD I USED - AFTER NEARLY A MONTH THEY HAVE TODAY REPLIED TO SAY EVRI CANT FIND THE ITEMS AND NO REFUND WILL BE GIVEN!!!! ABSOLUTE THEFT - DO NOT USE ZALANDO!!!!!"
"Delivery not delivered. Contacted customer service who sent me a legal form to fill out. Sent it back promptly, today is now 14 days since I returned the form and have had no communication from them. Contacted customer service today on live chat. Victor on chat then tells me I haven't filled out ""place"" under place section, I've only put the date. I have asked what does it mean by place, Victor has then ignored my question. So I have asked again which he totally avoided and told me a legal form has to be filled out correctly. So I asked for a 3rd time and he ended the chat. Awful customer service from this company, this was the first and will be the last time I ever use them. Judging by other comments it seems to be a trend. I just want my item resent or my money back as I have paid for something I have not received"
"Beware. Terrible customer service. They made a mistake, sending me a wrong size and now making me pay extra for it. Operators on online chat are disgusting. I will never order from these again."
I am happy with the item. However the courier did not attend on the scheduled date and when I spoke with customer services one of their agents was rude and ended the chat and others just continued to send canned messages which didn’t answer my query. The matter was eventually sorted out but their customer services requires improvement.
"Two of my orders with Zalando never arrived so I really would not use them if looking for something for a specific event, this has never happened to me with any other online retailer. When I queried (as both times the order tracking said the package had arrived) I was told my packaged had been left with security, I don't live in an apartment building. I was refunded promptly."
"Such bad experience with zalando services , i got order trainers, and they send total different item instead, such a poor service, i do not recommend this website for shopping"
Zalando DOES NOT refund. They will keep your money for almost a month - do hard in a cost of living crisis!  The last 3 orders have been a battle for my money. They take over 3 weeks and a customer service is a joke with their script. Don't buy there and save yourself a hassle 😢
PLEASE KEEP AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. Brought a Tommy Hilfger Gilet paid Via paypal.. Zalando emailed me with Bogus tracking number . waited 5 weeks Gilet did NOT arrive. Paypal refunded my money in full
"Very quick delivery, easy to order on website and product is exactly as described. Very happy with my purchase!"
Awful experience and customer service... don't waste time and money with them as i did... this is ridiculous...
"EMMA is taking agreed price match promises from customers and WITHDRAWING them.  I had a price match already agreed and sent proof of details which were agreed.  Chased price match refund payment, and EMMA said no!!!  So DISHONEST COMPANY agrees to refund the difference and DO NOT FOLLOW THROUGH THEREFORE STEALING FROM CUSTOMERS.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY."
"I see there are a lot of negative reviews, but I never had a single issue with them. I've bought from Zalando for many years and always got great deals and, whenever I didn't like something, I just sent it back and get a refund, no questions asked.Same for the customer service: every time I had any kind of query they always replied usefully and promptly.I appreciate the fact some people might not like the fact you cannot try stuff on before buying it, but that's the downside of any online shopping.Don't be put off by negative reviews and give it a try! You might be surprised :)"
Very poor service crap website no customer service skills don’t help at all slow delivery waste of time. Take the mick to pack a parcel a deliver one item.
It is easy to speak to a human at customer services; unfortunately it appears that they are trained to give unhelpful and insincere responses. It is evident that other reviewers have had similar difficulties.
"If i'd looked here first I wouldn't have used them however my experience was first class. Great price for a Air Jordan Hoodie for my nephew, promised delivery by 31/10 I got it yesterday, over the moon"
"Never received my refund despite sending item back 1 month ago using their tracked postage label. Customer service asked me to provide evidence of postage, even though their website is showing that my item has been delivered to them. Absolutely useless company that I will never use again"
"Used to be really good but is NOT anymore.Zalando stopped offering student discounts, customer care advisors are often useless, and they are still delivering with Hermes / Evri which is one of the worst UK parcel delivery companies (severe delays, parcels left unattended, lost or stolen - most of the time stolen by the same Evri warehouse staff or delivery drivers).My last order was not delivered at all, and I'm still chasing Zalando to get my refund.Sorry Zalando, that was my last and final order. Never again."
"All the negative reviews here are 100% right. Avoid Zalando like the plague; unless you're a masochist & want unbelievable stress and hassle. Evri managed to ""lose"" my order before it even left their warehouse. And that is where the tracking updates ended... Trying to contact Evri (the worst courier service ever) was literally impossible. Evri, you're PATHETIC.Zalando customer service was diabolical. I had to contact at least 6, or 7 different Zalando staff via chat & telephone. The first person gave me all of 60 seconds of their time, before telling me they had to ""deal with other customers"" and then abruptly ended the chat. During at least 3 of the other chats/phone calls, staff blatantly lied to me, and fobbed me off. I had to push & push to get anywhere, and every single person told me something different.Be aware: if you're insane enough to purchase from Zalando and Evri ""loses"" your order (loses, yeah, right), Zalando will require the customer to complete a 'Legal Form', the wording of which is full of absurd contradictions - it is obviously written by mad people. If you fill it in correctly, or don't fill it in correctly, they will STILL say it's not filled in correctly and won't accept it. Trying to get a refund from these jokers is an absolute nightmare.This is the most Kafkaesque online company I've ever had the displeasure to encounter.BEWARE!!!!!!!!! ORDER AT YOUR PERIL"
"I have shopped many times with Zalando without complaint.  They deliver quickly and handle returns and refunds effectively.  This time I made the mistake of purchasing some items from a ‘Zalando Partner’ - Massimo Dutti along with some other items directly from Zalando.  Zalando took my money for the total shopping bag so, as far as I’m concerned, my contract is with Zalando.  All the items were sent back on 6th October 2022 and were received on 11th October 2022.  Zalando processed their refund in 48 hrs.  It is now 15 days since Zalando’s Partner received their items back and - nothing.  I’ve emailed Zalando 5 times and they just fob me off with ‘we haven’t received your parcel’ or ‘I’ll chase thus up with Evri’ (parcel was sent via Royal Mail).  They don’t answer questions or comment on tracking evidence.  Best avoid shopping at a Zalando Partner.  Wish me luck."
"I ordered two dressess that turned out be too big, therefore I decided to return them. They refused my refund (what is interesting.. only one of them for this absurdal reason) telling me that found some signs of use, what was impossible as dresses been worn only a few minutes just to try the right size and fit. Tried to contact them for more explanation, (what exactly ""they found"") but refused to answer saying that my case is already closed. After pushing their customer service, suddenly they argued that found smell of cigarettes on it. It's quite interesting as I'm not smoking!!! And realized that this dress is no longer available on Zalando website, which may be potential reason that they don't need it anymore and try to blame me for this.Disgusting experience.. never againI'll never purchase anything from them as even checking the size at clean home may result in a refund being rejected!"
"Purchased a pair of Reebok shoes, a week after purchasing the shoes I contacted customer service to notify them that my order hadn't been dispatched to be told they would contact their partner and my patience would be appreciated. Three days later I contacted them again for an update only to be told to be patient. The very next day I received an email to say that my shoes were no longer in stock and they were refunding me accordingly. The shoes are showing as in stock on the website so I don't understand. I wouldn't purchase again from this website."
"Sent an order back using their Evri Parcelshop returns and label provided in parcel to do so easily.Day 6 of return process I checked Evri tracking and it still not collected so notified Zalando…told to wait 14 days and I will be refunded regardless as I had completed my side of the process.Day 14 ask for refund as still shows “waiting to be collected” and told they will send email to Evri and wait 48hours for response and I will be refunded.Day 17 ask for refund and asked all questions previously asked and told “your item shows it’s not been collected I’ll get Evri to collect it via a 48hr email”…Day 19 still not collected I WANT MY REFUND !! Dealt with Sharon and Faith online and neither had a clue what they were doing just replying robotic default replies.Day 20 request a manager and get an email off Daniel….says can he have the tracking number and receipt sent in pictures to the email.Also Day 20…Daniel “hi I have checked the tracking and it’s not been collected, I will send an email with a response expected in 48 hours” but no refund…Day 22 “when item returns it’s 5 days processing in warehouse” and still it shows not collected…Honestly, customer service is absolutely shocking, £235 out of pocket and not one of them communicate to one another, now filling out the gov.uk money claim online to sue them for loss of money.Honestly I was a major user of Zalando and they have had my final business now."
"Second pair of Boots from Zolanda. I’ve seen the bad reviews but the boots are fab! They came quicker than I expected, fit great and I will be using them again,"
"Update 19/11/22 feels like hundreds of representations to get my refund including emailing Megan Keller Malley Zalando UK GM no reply no refund, threatened legal action can’t use UK MCO because they have no UK HQ, raised PayPal case and charge back with credit card company if no result will try EU MCO small claims we all buy everything on line and say service is some circumstances is poor but Zalando are utterly appalling and process is clearly systematic fraud by “gaming” the 0.5% of lost deliveries through dead end CS channels designed to spiral customers with lost returns to cave in, disgusting and fraudulent, lm not giving up.Original PostDon’t be put if by negative reviews, let them lose your return, then post 5 stars!!!!!  I returned a £135.00 pair of Nike using Zalandos “own” return service and courier a month ago, 22/9/22, confirmation on Hermes tracking they accepted it and hard copies of postal/dispatch tickets, all provided to Zalando 10 times,  l’ve sent at least 20 messages through every channel on their site and at every single reply l’ve had utterly different and conflicting responses, just plain lies about having all the information sent or being able to read an adobe formatted pdf l sent 4 times, the only service Zalando email address reply says  “this account is not monitored” and “do not reply” so your forced to go back on chat to lies, incompetence and both.  Same on phone calls there’s a magical department called “Payments” the CS team can’t get details from and customers can’t communicate with so your left in the dark with no goods and no refund.  This is e-commerce at its absolute worst! I wasn't even told l needed to fill in a form in called “Legal Statement Return” until my 10th refund chase enquiry, it contains exactly the same information l already sent and is contained on the orders details and my account, there is absolutely no reason customers should have to complete forms like this!!.  It’s in place for one reason to deter you from being able to challenge and chase your refund, it’s a massive con/rip off plain and simple.  As far as lm concerned once it’s in the hands of the sellers courier it’s with the seller.  Simple example of how best in class e commerce businesses manage this, when you return goods to Amazon you get a refund on proof of postage, you don’t get ignored, patronised, lied to for a month, disgraceful, and for clarity lm not a Zalando newb, ld estimate l’ve spent at least a couple of grand with them over the years, done and done, unacceptable, BTW still don’t have my £135.00 back yet either!"
"So I really wanted to order some trainers in the adidas sale, but they were sold out on the adidas site. I found them at the discounted price on Zalando. After reading the negative reviews I was really worried, but couldn’t resist the discount so gave it a go. The trainers came as promised, and very quickly. The communication regards to dispatch was good. No complaints at all, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy from Zalando again"
"The most useless customer experience ever. I returned an item that was awful quality, it started peeling when my toddler tried it on inside the house. Every time she bumped anything, the shoe top layer peeled away. So I returned it and then was contacted by zalando three or four times in one day to say same thing, item worn can’t be refunded, despite me emailing them about the problem. It’s like they can’t read the emails I sent them. Same line, I had not emailed them so can’t refund.  Over and over."
"I have shopped with Zalando since 2018, I have made almost 70 orders, and I think I even left a nice review here for them back then.This past years has been a complete DISASTER.They have 3 times lost my returns, and if you do not email them over and over, you can forget your monies.This morning I have exchanged 10 emails already with their ""customer service"", providing all they have been asking (so I have spent my morning in front of this laptop) and nothing has been achieved so far.You interact with a different person every email, that requests different documentation. Is it so hard for them to read the previous email? it is all in there! it is all part of one conversation!I had to provide 4 times all the codes of the clothes I have returned - why can't they just look into my order and see the one I have chosen to return??????I have requested over and over an address to send the documentation for legal action and they strangely forget to answer that question a in every email.This has caused me stress, anxiety, waste of my time and so far monies.I am just waiting to receive the monies and then I will finally delete the app, I gave them far too many chances - pity, they used to be great.This is a scam, you have to fight to have your monies back, even if you follow the right procedure!!"
Very good online prices let down by a rubbish delivery partner aka Evri aka Hermes who lost the order. Fingers crossed I will get a refund..but will have to wait 5 days for that!Won’t be using Zalando again any time soon…Avoid!
"They are the worst company ever!I bought an item that never arrived, they said the courier tried to attempt to deliver. I have a 24h camera on my front door and NO ONE from the bloody Hermes/Evri has ever showed up for delivery like other companies did. They are rubbish. Their customer services is even worse!!! My refund will be processed in up to 30 days! Thieves."
"I I'm love with you Zalando, you're my new favourite shop in the world, I love you xx"
"Bought Hugo Boss Polo, says on the site PAULE, Dark Blue, Regular Fit. Came Slim Fit. Cannot log in to Zalando UK to initiate return. Scam. Stay away."
"Made an order 2 weeks ago and it was sent out for delivery with Evri and of course ended up lost. Customer services were no help. I contacted them to discuss and they kept directing back to the delivery tracker assuring me it will be out for delivery not answering any questions I had after an email from Zalando had confirmed it was lost. I was then sent a legal statement to complete, when I asked for help they told me to check the tracker again as it will be out for delivery. No staff seemed competent to read any email sent thoroughly. I made another order as I had a gift voucher to use and they are still answering questions I have not asked and not relevant at all. Awful service"
"Terrible company. Order never arrived and after contacting Zalando they send what they call a legal form to fill details out and return by email. Each time you send it back a different person from Zalando asks again for different information, i had at least 5 of them.So they have your money but receive no goods. Seem to be based in Germany, Other people on Trustpilot seem to have the same problem."
Shocking customer service - items significantly reduced in a sale a few days after ordering. Once I contacted I was given a copy and paste answer that said prices change and nothing could be done! Will definitely not be ordering from then again!
They have good stock but there delivery is poor they been packaging my order for about 3 days and is only a pair of shoes.
"Purchased some items online. Delivery to take a little while. Items packaged well and as described. I arranged for the returns to be collected, but no courier turned up to collect them. The day I returned the items to one of their pick up points I received an email from them that the item I kept was now cheaper. I emailed them straight away to ask would they refund the difference they asked for the product number et cetera which I sent (the product was still in stock in my size and colour) and they never replied. When I did give them a few days to respond - they didn’t! So I chased them - they did not understand my query.When did they reply, they said the item is now out of stock but you can reorder. I didn’t want to reorder the item! I wanted them to refund me the difference! You get an email fromA different person. Had they replied sooner I would have returned the item I kept. And reordered it at the cheaper amount. Now they took so long to reply - Conveniently the item is out of stock. Someone new replies to each email so it’s hard for them to provide good customer service"
"They have a lot of good stock, however delivery is atrocious, you have to pay for delivery and the delivery is very slow, it takes them around 5 days just to send the item to the courier, after which it takes a few days for the courier to deliver"
"I have made 3 separate orders of items from Monki and Arket and all have arrived within a week. The items were at a substantial discount compared to that of the original retailer. Two things to note are that prices do tend to fluctuate and stock goes very quickly however, if you miss out, simply request a ‘back in stock’ notification. Mark Zalando as a VIP on your email and you will surely secure the item. Quite a few of the negative reviews are linked to returns, you can safeguard yourself in two ways: 1. Go to the store and  try on said item or one similar so that you are confident of sizing,  2. Pay using a credit card or PayPal so that you can dispute the transaction if your order/ return doesn’t arrive."
"Just recently purchased an item from Zealand’s for the first time, can’t fault the delivery time and product (football boots). The fit was perfect so did not have to return so can only score on the delivery and product👍 Would defo use again."
"I liked my first purchase with Zalando. But when shopping the second time, I was surprised that they suddenly increased the price of the item in my basket. Not happy. I removed all items in my basket. Will shop somewhere else instead."
"One item was lost completely, another item I had to return and after a week of waiting for a refund, Zalando customer service (who bounce me to a different agent on every email) told me they refunded me on the day of the return - I received no such refund. The item that never turned up I have been told I have to wait at least 14 days for a refund, with no information or updates on where the package has gone. Customer service is absolutely useless, sending boilerplate replies that have nothing to do with my messages and issues. This has been one of the longest and most stressful e-commerce experiences of my life and the final nail in the coffin for me never using Zalando again. I am out £125, with no items to show for it, and no sign that the money will ever be returned to me. Both the delivery and returns and customer service is the height of unprofessionalism. Do yourself a favour and avoid Zalando at all costs."
"I wish -5 stars was an option. The daily stress and time I am incurring in trying to get my money back is unacceptable. I was originally sent an invalid returns QR code. I then received a further one via email which was also invalid. At this point we are several trips and tens of emails into the process. They then, despite me telling them I don’t have a printer, sent a courier to my house on 3 consecutive days (which I couldn’t cancel) which required a label I couldn’t print to return the item. Another ten or so emails later (each from different representatives who fail to read the previous email) and I have a correct code to return the item. I dropped off the parcel 10 days ago, on the tracking information it’s still not received by them. I have tried to live chat with them twice, they have ended the chat. I have emailed further, nothing happens. I am honestly disgusted with them I just want my money back. I have asked for the complaints procedure over 10 times, I have never been given it or better contact information. I hate to think how they treat vulnerable customers. If I do not receive a refund in the coming days I will be suing them for the money back, my time and compensation from the stress. Moral of the story is shop elsewhere."
"They just ripped me off with my order! I received it, no problem went to check sizing on their website and same item is now much cheaper! I expect a refund for the difference - had I waited one day I would have saved more"
I ordered late on Thursday evening after hesitating and reading bad reviews here and across social media platforms. I decided to go ahead knowing I have purchase protection on my credit card and thought no more of it. This morning I received my order in perfect condition and delivery was super quick. I’d happily buy from here again.
"Worst company I ever had to deal with! I returned expensive sunglasses in September, till now I haven't got my refund. When I asked them for my money or at least reason why I dont get refunded, they keep on sending me same answer ""I’m sorry we weren’t able to offer you a refund. This is an unusual situation, and when it does occasionally happen, our investigation team treats each order individually."" I sent them an Offcial Letter before claim and all of sudden someone replied ""I am sorry to hear that you have not received your refund yet. Kindly note that your returned was already booked at our warehouse and our internal team are working towards your refund.Please be patient once your refund has been issued you will be notified of the same.""One week gone and again I received email saying they won't be able to refund me. NO REASON, NO EXPLANATION, NO MONEY.  I was customers with them for years, but now I am taking legal actions  and will never buy from them again. Be careful. Zalando are thefts."
Was dubious about using this retailer due to the negative reviews. My order was processed efficiency & delivered via independent courier within a few days.
"I rarely bother to review companies, but decided to based on the poor reviews it has. Maybe people are only motivated if there's something to complain about?I bought a jacket from this company last week. Delivery estimate was given for the following week over a three-day ETA. It arrived on the first day promptly.Delivery emails were really clear and helpful.The item was exactly as expected and £5 cheaper (£8 if you include the competition's packaging fee).I'd definitely shop with this company again.  Thank you ."
"I wish I could give zero star if possible. Ordered a bag online while on sale but received email saying it was out of stock. Contacted customer service and they refused to honour the price difference since I ordered the same bag before sale. Response received was just a standard text which was helpless. I escalated and finally got a response saying they could offer the same discount if I managed to order within 3 days. Kept checking every day and showed out of stock, guess what, it became available on the 4th day. The inaccuracy of the stock level was another issue and it showed two were in stock when ordered. Zalando have no intention to offer a discount or do not value their customers at all. This is one of the worst companies I have had experience with and I won't purchase from them anymore."
What an amazing website and company! The website and app are user-friendly and the prices are competitive. I would say Zalando is my go to website for mainly training gear and I am also starting to use it for everyday where as well. Their shipping is fast and the best thing about this company is the returns process which I honestly feel is probably one of the best out there! The returns are free and if there is an issue with a product the refunds or returns are immediate with no questions asked. The customer is always right seems to be their motto so please keep this up.
"I have returned a 3 package for £180, first I refunded 4 months ago,2 package more 3 months ago and I still haven't received my refund. I have sent 8 emails to Zalando and they have asked to send a form. Once I sent the form, they said that they spoke to the driver and found out that the package was not delivered to the warehouse so, they can't give me a refund. These packages have been going missing constantly but usually when I send a legal form I get my refund back but not this time. This time I haven't received any contact from zalando and I still haven't received my refund so I will not be dealing with zalando anymore and will not be buying from them.I will try to contact my bank"
"My package arrived on time, but given one star as they use Evri (formerly known as Hermes). Unacceptable."
"Easy to use website, item came exactly as described and in perfect condition, no issues what so ever. Definitely recommend this site"
"Delivery always on time, extremely easy app to use. Customer service satisfied - instantly replied emails. Thank you"
If I could give less than 1 star the I would. This company is the worst I have ever dealt with. I have returned 3 parcels and have documentary evidence of them being collected and returned to Zalando but they are refusing to refund me. They end on online chats when they don't want to answer and ask for the same information repeatedly. I've had 22 email exchanges with them in 1 1/2 days and still getting nowhere. I've asked for their complaints process/policy and they just say email the general help desk
"I've been using Zalando for years with no problem.  I like their choice of goods and system of try now and pay later.  All very good until it all goes horribly wrong.  I should have just sent all the articles back but I wanted to keep one and when I did the return form it was reduced,  Instead of ordering a new one at the reduced price, I negotiated a reduction and kept one and sent the other back.  They gave me a reimbursement but kept the reduction.  So i never got the reduction.  I argued the toss for days but they were absolutely incapable of doing maths so i got nowhere."
Ordered some shoes one pair didn’t turn up…zalando state were all sent in same parcel…. Which it didn’t!!!!!!!!!! PayPal case opened as they refuse to refund or replace shoes 6 weeks later still ongoing!!! Avoid these scammers and shop elsewhere
If I could give one star wish I could. Ordered shoes that was due 21/09/2022. Still not arrived nobody will response to my messages. Absolute scammers. Raised it with PayPal now good job I used them to pay so I can attempt to get my money back.
"My parcel never arrived, they also confirmed that over the phone to me... but still I have to print out a form and send it to them while they they have my money in the mean time, staff are like robots.. they only have a few things they can say to you, absolutely crap, avoid even if you are desperate unless you don't like your money"
"Zalando delivered my package to the wrong address and the courier left it outside a random house. The occupants don't have it so it's clearly been stolen. Zalando customer service have been TERRIBLE dealing with this - ignored for days, told repeatedly it was delivered and accepted by me. But here I am with no package and A LOT of money down. It's totally unacceptable for a HUGE company to leave customers out of pocket like this. Unacceptable, DO NOT ORDER FROM ZALANDO"
"Avoid this company unless you want to keep your order and not have to return any part of it.I bought a number of items, 11 in total at a cost of £650 in total. A few of the items were strange sizing and didn't fit so i went online and raised a return for these items so i was returning about £400 worth.I was sent a return label for EVRI packed all up and dropped off at my nearest store with receipt.Issues started with the return seemingly sitting with EVRI for over 3 weeks not moving. Contacting EVRI is no mean feat as their systems are set up to ignore and lead you round in circles but eventually i spoke to a human who told me as the label was sent to me by Zalando they couldn't talk to me only the owner of the return label, Zalando.On contacting Zalando all they kept repeating was they weren't refunding as the package had not been returned. On telling them i know this but they need to instruct EVRI to investigate they refused and kept repeating no parcel had been delivered then they stopped responding to emails.I later tried to log into my Zalando account to see if there was anyone else i could contact i kept on getting an error message and unable to log in. This happened when trying to log in on my laptop and my mobile app. Thinking this was strange i turned on the VPN on my mobile and surprisingly i logged in no problem, turned off the VPN and unable to log in with an error message.So its obvious this is Zalandos way of dealing with returns they say haven't been delivered to them by EVRI, ignore the obvious proof i sent their package via their returns provider, ignore emails and when you keep complaining they block your IP address so you cannot log in or even open another account.My CC provider is now dealing with the refund directly.AVOID THIS LOT AT ALL COSTS."
What do I start with?I had my eye on a pair of Nike platform trainers. There were only on sale at zalando so I purchased. However I came across the trustpilot for zalando and immediately regretted it. The bad reviews just went on and on!!!.... BUT I didn't need to!I was kept informed by email very efficiently! The delivery was mega fast! Packed safely. Genuine product!I really don't know if it's the patience of other customers but I'm definitely a returning customer after my first order.Thank you Zalando
"absolutely shocking experience with customer care latelyi have been loyal customer for yearsnot only the items arriving wrong but also customer care not refunding my money for returns , saying i never sent it back when i have proof of postingi have no other way just to contact my bank to freeze the transaction and ask my bank to revive my money backemails onlycustomer care on the phone doesnt transfer you to the investigation team or any other supervisori left frustrated and in minus money wise , stressful experience where my favourite online website started treating me like that"

"Shocking in four days this is day 17 no refund on a call they would advice getting sorted end call then receive email sorry can’t accept had to pdf my driving licence god don’t know where to start all for refund this company need reporting well I have for fraud through my bank and I will take it further I have proof of calls and emails it’s a disgrace robbing people , daft me photo copy my driving licence , you will not get away with this at all with me all foreign not racist have a coloured nephew got all proof I have"
"Ordered Converse trainers, Dainty size 4. Paid full price. Always buy these trainers.These appear to be fake. -they are the wrong shape, minor variations in detail ( compared with the authentic ons) and are slightly bigger than the genuine version.Unfortunately, I’ve had to wear them as needed trainers for my holiday.I will never use Zalando again."
"Bought a North Face Coat for 269.99.Received a pair of Nike Trainers and a pair of Nike Tech Fleece joggers. Returned them as they’d clearly messed up my order and my reason for return was “wrong items received”I received an email today saying -‘Thanks for getting in touch.I'm writing to let you know that we weren’t able to process the refund for your recent returned item.All returned items must be in their original condition (unworn and with the labels still attached) for a return to be accepted. We are unable to accept this return today as not on the Zalando store.Simply reply to this email to let me know if you’d like us to send the item back to your shipping address. If I don’t hear from you in the next 7 days, we’ll go ahead and get rid of the item for you.Looking forward to hearing back from you.Have a great week!Tabitha’I called Zalando and initially explained my problem, expecting an understanding and appropriate resolution. I would’ve been happy for them to just ship my actual coat at this point as I’d placed my order on the 3rd of Sept and not received my (incorrect) order until the 7th. It’s now the 15th Sept, they received my return on the 12th Sept and decided only today to email me that. So they have £270 of my money, a pair of brand new unworn trainers I didn’t even take out the shoe box to look at, just lifted the paper that covers the trainers. Brand new pair of Nike Tech Fleece joggers, still all with tags attached as I clearly didn’t order them so would’ve NEVER worn them..Upon calling them I was initially told that I should’ve called them to inform them of the problem with the order, I explained I had already put my return reason in on THEIR app when creating the return. I tried escalating the call to a manager and was told “there are no managers here..” The lady then started pretending she couldn’t hear me saying “hello..hello” then hung up on me. Luckily calls are recorded, whether or not they listen to them is another matter entirely!Called straight back and spoke with Eric, who understood the problem and said he’d email me back straight away. His response was less than satisfactory -‘ Thank you for reaching Zalando.Please be informed that I have forwarded your case to the appropriate queue for further assistance.They shall contact you with feedback.Your patience is highly appreciated as this concern is being looked into.Kind regards,Eric’Forwarded my case to the appropriate QUEUE?! What??? What does this even mean? I’ve been a Zalando customer since 2013. In my last email I sent them I told them how abysmal their customer service is, how clearly out of sync their whole company is if they can’t see a return request REASON - which the app specifically asks for as you can’t return the order without adding one and I also told them to just close my account and refund me my money. Absolute waste of time and energy.They have become a joke of a company and a complete circus. Honestly, shop elsewhere. They are well and truly not worth your time, money or loyalty. They clearly have no respect, and for that reason I will never ever shop there again."
"Avoid this companyBeen customer for almost 6 year , had few issues in the past but not like the few purchase I made last few weeks , the Hermes or Evri is a joke . Selected pick up point for delivery but on the system show delivered to my address with no confirmation ,twice they left the parcel behind door however I selected  pickup point .now two parceles missing but confirmed as delivered to my address .that's me not buying anything unless the use reliable company to deliver goods"
"Can't lie, I was a little worried about ordering due to some reviews but I couldn't get these shoes anywhere else in stock. Ordered without issue, simple ordering. One bit of feedback is delivery isn't updated much but the delivery date at check out was accurate.Shoes didnt fit so returned. I posted the return 4 days ago (weekend included) and received my refund today with absolutely no issueBought shoes in size up and again, delivered fineAbsolutely no issue and glad I never let reviews about refunds etc scare me off"
"I was sceptical buying from zalando as I read many bad reviews about company. But as I used them previously, but long time ago, decided to give it a try and was not disappointed. Both times everything went smoothly. I had issues, but they have been resolved very quickly. One of the item was defected, zalando offered me a partial refund, which I was happy with, because the item is still wearable. And the second time I bought a t-shirt for my husband and it did not suit him, so we send it back. No issues whatsoever. Evri picked it up and we received a refund. Good customer service. Will be using them again!"
Excelent service. Please keep the good work.
I ordered a pair of Nike flip flops which i sent back almost a month ago and have still not recieved a refund. 6/9/22.  The chat assistant on the website was slow and very unhelpful I wouldn't use this site to buy anything I certinatly will not use them again. I still don't know when I will and if I will recieve my refund
"Saw a pair of shoes I liked. Left it a night to think about it and they were sold out in my size the next day. Left my email address for 'Notify me when back in stock'.The very next day, 1 pair of shoes in my size were back in stock, so I placed my order, without being suspicious or thinking this was too convenient. It's not like a factory would make 1 pair of shoes so where did this solitary pair come from??Shoes arrived in a box that was very old looking. Looked like it had been in the warehouse for some time. Old damage, that could not have been caused from the delivery service in just one trip.Realised then that the shoes sent were not the ones that I had ordered. Were similar in some respects but my shoes cost £54.99 and the ones I was sent cost £27.99Weirdly, both shoes have the same name so this might be a deliberate scam for Zalando to pocket the difference of my money. But no reference numbers on my order match those on the box so surely warehouse staff should know?I contacted their customer service email address and they state they will reply usually within 1 - 2 days. Two weeks later I had still heard nothing back so I contacted an online chat. Not helpful at all. They cannot send me out the correct shoes because they don't do that. Instead I can return the wrong shoes FREE of charge (even though the return was free anyway so thanks for that....)And then I have to order the correct shoe again when it comes back into stock and hope they don't try the same scam again. No compensation offered for wasting my time, no gesture of good will etc. Just rubbish customer service.I was then going to ask as to how I can complain about this (given that the email address is clearly ignored) and the agent terminated the chat saying if there was anything else I needed, I could start a new chat.Take your money elsewhere."
"I would give a zero star, but unfortunately the option is not available.Ordered schools bags for the children, received a random message that the courier had an issue with the delivery. No idea what issue they had as I have received 10 different deliveries since.No further update on when bags will be delivered.Spoke to zalando customer service, complete waste of time. Unable to help in any way, unable to forward my call to anyone that can help, and then hung up while I was still speaking to the advisor.I order online regularly, by far one of the worst customer service and updates. Avoid ordering, feather pay an extra couple of pounds and order from a company that can fulfill your order or can at least help if you call in"
I ordered some white leather converse. They did look fake so I sent them back. I received my order within three days and my refund within three days of sending back. Item not very good but customer service was good.
I was very sceptical buying from Zalando given the other bad reviews. But can honestly say the whole process was extremely smooth. I ordered my trainers on Friday afternoon and they were delivered by Thursday (this was over the bank holiday weekend as well). I also opted for them to be delivered to a parcel shop to try and save too much hassle with evri. As other reviews have said I want to try and reassure anyone else that is worried about ordering from here as in the end the whole experience was positive and I was able to get a pair of trainers that were sold out everywhere else :)
"I ordered some jeans in the sale. They arrived promptly.  Unfortunately they did not fit me well so I ended up returning them.This was the basis of my positive review because I found the process so easy which is really unusual these days.The ordering process was slick and efficient and the item turned up in time.The return process was just as slick.  Picked up from my house and the money back in my account in no time.I'd definitely use Zalando again even if the product is slightly more expensive as it's rare to get good service and to me, it's a pleasant surprise and worth the money to avoid any hassle.Well done Zalando"
"Decided to buy from this company as had items I was looking for at good price. Wish I hadn't! Given wrong information by live chat person and despite him saying charge would be refunded (transcript can prove this) they have refused to honour this. No attempt to provide good customer service, orher than a discount on next order. Thank you Zalando but there will be no order! Poor service when your staff are giving out misinformation."
"I ordered from Zalando because the trainers i wanted were out of stock everywhere, The string of bad reviews did get me anxious about my order, But Zalando come through with my order without any issues and was delivered within 3 days of placing my order"
"Zalando was my first choice in online buying but after 10 years I am done with it. I was buying in Nl, Es, _It and Croatian Zalando, and every now and then their 'system' decide to allow bank payments only. Not that I only have to waste my time putting the datas via my bank account but every time I have to pay more (fee). I was contacting Zalando several times but they just said that they cannot do nothing and close the chat or finish with the emails. I am buying everyday online and NEVER had this stupid experience with any of this web pages. Luckily, there is a million options for buying online so for me this is not the problem. Zalando does not care for their customers and do not listen to them. This is so UNPROFESSIONAL! Bye Zalando, your competition will be happy."
"Zalando Blocked our account cause of Their MistakeI've wrote a message to Zalando support team about an error in their application, cause weird seemingly test addresses where shown in address selection screen.Seems like Zalando support team simply removed/blocked our whole account, which all our purchase history without any thoughts.So be aware about it. Your account could be blocked at any point of time. And if you would try to help - you will be punished.So try to find other company if you value your nerves, or be ready for bad support.If not for this complete blocker I would give 4 start at least."
Fraudulent company. They do not provide refunds and state to customers that goods were not returned. They have thousands on instagram comments warning customers not to shop with them and then the retailer removes any comments
"A few months ago i discovered this website and it seemed great. Placed an order, was delivered through hermes(was lucky to receive it). Sizes were perfect and my order was good. Now i tried to log in to place another order, just to find out that i can not log in. Tried to reset my password several times, did not receive one email with my link to reset the password. So got in touch with them, they advised they will send an email to confirm some security in regards with my identity. Did that and the reply was that my account gained access from a third party and it is now blocked and can't get access back. But i could register for a new account. After reading some reviews about them, this issue is not only mine. So i will not bother to make another account, just to be hacked again by somebody.This company needs to increase their security or they will loose customers."
Second time jv ordered from this company bktb times the shoes were way to small I'm a 6 and it's like trying a size 4 on. Last time I ordered I waited ages for the refund same problem. This time. Trying to talk to there customer service is ridiculous they are absolute dumb nuts. I think they go out your way repeating useless information so that u just end the chat. I returned my item a week ago still haven't had a email to say they have recieved it. won't be ordering from these again both times the sizes have come up like 2 sizes 2 small and I have had to harrass them for a refund. Don't waste your time and money.
This is a company that deliberately does not tell you what items are included for a 10% discount.Which is false advertising.When you question these people regarding about the discounts you're met with the 10% discount was applied.Unfortunately as this company is inept they deliberately haven't stated what items were going to be included in the 10% discount.So instead of me getting £11 off my order I received £3.60 off my order which was definitely not the 10%
Great customer service. Refund was delayed for some reason. Sent an e-mail Sunday 14.30pm by 15.30 had a notification that refund is processed. Very impressed.
"I am still waiting for my refund. A few weeks passed. And it seems, one parcel is not delivered back to them by Evri after 3 weeks!Zalando can be good at times, but I had some issues with them before about refund and I start to trust them less and less.. Always thinking, if I will receive my refund or I need to deal with that again. I think, it is time to change a shop."
I ordered 5 items and they were delivered from 3 different suppliers and therefore i had to do 3 different/separate returns! One had no returns info either so i had to call up. How is that convenient!!!??? They need to sort out their business model. Still have no refund after 3 weeks with one item. Won't be using them again.
"No delivery of trainers. Spoke to the 2 bit company and they promised to give me a refund, but after reading the reviews I don't think I'll get it back. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!"
If I could give a negative I would. I returned 2 parcels both confirmed as received by the company but no refund! You can't speak to anybody as you call and they say they have to send an email to the relevant department.i have sent proof of postage and am owed £1175 never had an issue with any other online company. They are thieves! Avoid!! I have raised with the police and will be taking further action
Ordered a size 14 got sent a size 10 !!Order shows a size 14.  No online chat to try and sort. Now Ive got to return wait for a refund and reorder and hope I get sent the correct size this time. Not impressed for my first order with Zalanda
"I love them. Fast delivery, refund always very fast.Thank you!"
I was a bit worried about ordering from here because of the reviews on trust pilot but my trainers came within 5 days and I was kept updated by zalando on my order.My trainers arrived perfectly the box was slightly damaged but nothing to complain about. Would definitely order from here again as best price for the trainers I wanted.
Zalando took nearly 3 weeks to deliver and when the arrived I noticed they had sent the wrong size shoes. To make it worse they had done this on purpose as the delivery note stated we’ve run out of your sizes 8’s why not give these size 10’s a try! it’s been over a month and I still have not received a refund. I would avoid
"I read the trust pilot reviews before ordering, and was a bit nervous. However the package arrived quickly, as described, no complaints at all.It's probably a bit galling for someone who it didn't work out for to see the five star reviews but I can only base it on my experience, which was flawless."
Very disappointed by customer service. Couple weeks ago my account was hacked and till now the issue hasn’t been solved and I cannot access my account!
Absolutely disgusting company! Took money for something they didn’t have in stock! Brought my son a present to only get a email saying it’s cancelled…yet no refund to replace it. Don’t buy anything from them! Won’t give me a managers contact etc
"After reading the poor reviews I had been skeptical about using Zalando, though they were the only company who held an item in stock. Pleased to say that the item was delivered on time with no issues from either Zalando or the courier. Would recommend."
"Ordered a pair of traniers, they were too small so I have returned them. Their refund policy is scandalous. Once they have your return they ask you to wait for 14 DAYS for a refund. They have had my return for 10 days. If I don't get the refund I will be doing a chargeback.Will never Purchase from them again."
"Awful customer service!I have returned pair of shoes that didn’t fit, followed all rules, dropped parcel to my local Evri in my local Tesco. Nothing. Sent them am email chasing refund, no response, phoned and provided Evri receipt confirming delivery back to Zalando. Was told that all ok and refund to follow. Waited a few days and phoned again to be told that parcel apparently was empty.., and was blamed for sending an empty box even that 2 days ago I was assured everything was fine! This is unbelievable and I Will Never shop again with Zalando. Avoid!"
"ordered sons school shoes, clearly package had been lost by evri but all zolando keep saying is be patient my parcel is on its way. they havent even tried to contact evri to see where my order is so basically cant get a refund. first time using and will be the last. wish I read reviews before ordering"
"Avoid ordering from this company. They delivered my order damaged. After discussing this with them and spending over an hour to speak to them, they told me to keep the item and they will compensate me for the damage, by way of a partial refund. Having accepted this, I wore the item, I was then told that they would not partially refund me and to return the item, knowing full well that I had worn them after receiving their instructions.After trying to raise a formal complaint, it’s been over a month and they keep saying to email them. Every time I email them to discuss this, they treat it as a new email and tell me to return the item if not worn. I have asked to raise this to a supervisor and they simply won’t allow me to speak to anyone who can provide even a little bit of understanding, completely caused by their wrongful advice and negligence.Avoid this company, there are so many other companies that provide a much better service."
"I made an order Asics shoes and was waiting for delivery almost 10 days and daily tracking my order on bad than baddest delivery service company Evri that was showing my order is on its way from the day i received an email of evri that we have received your order from zalando. But nothing was changed on my order tracking page., So i decided to call zalando customer service and they put my call on hold for almost half an hour to check my order status . At last after half an hour zalando customer service sent me an email that we are sorry about to inform you that our delivery partner (Evri) notified us that unfortunately your order has been lost on its way to you. So you have to wait for your refund bla bla... So my experience was very bad with zalando customer service and their delivery partner Evri. I think if you want to keep your money in zalando account for one without any return then you can make purchase from them otherwise my suggestion is to stay away from zalando as much as you can at least until you see your product is going to be delivered by Evri.. i want to give them -0/100 rating if possible."
Zalando app that pays you commissions is SCAM!  They take all the money and will disappear. They pay you for a short time to get your trust and friends and family. Then sweep all the money and destroy the app. They show you all the legal registrations too. Don't fall into their scam.
"I never had a problem with Zalando and I ordered from them for years. I have ordered a pair of shoes a week or so ago and when I received them and opened the box - it was clear that they were not new, but used. They were not even packed properly, they had worn soles, creases and scratch marks. Come on, Zalando, if I wanted to buy used shoes I would buy on Ebay for a fraction of what I paid on Zalando... I am very disappointed and I won't use your site again."
"Ordered an item for my son. Delivered to an incorrect location. Phoned to ask for it to be delivered and they said it has. Asked for a refund and they refused. Even though the call is recorded by them, they admit they know the consumer rights act, and stated they would NOT offer refunds. They are not a UK company, and clearly dont care about UK law. We spoke to 2x Customer service people, Mariah Tyler, and Mercedes Belavario who were completely belligerent. I would NEVER order from these people again. Be warned."
In a world of drop shipping. Zalandos 8 days delivery method making the buy experience agonising poor. Sadly I don't see how the company can compete. I will be looking to place orders else where.Difficult to communicate with. Hides contact details.
"I was cautious about buying from here as it has mixed reviews about the companies communication and the courier, I bought some trainers at a low price compared to resellers on Saturday and they arrived today (Wednesday) I was contacted regularly by Zalando and Evri with updates, I will definitely use this site again"
"ordered  size 13 Ralph Lauren trainers, received size 9! They do not do exchanges so  returned item the next day with Everi for a refund.   20 days later no refund and no rush from Zalando to pay after contacting them. Evri says item has been returned Zalando say we have not got it.  seems like they want to hold on to peoples money as long as possible.  Zalando have now emailed me to fill in legal statement for refund. This was completed. They then said they need a copy of my passport to process a refund!!"
"Paid £3.99 for delivery, goods tracked and held up at couriers. Waited 4 days (2 working days as should have been delivered on a weekend) after goods  arrived at courier Evri, with no progress on the tracking. No way of contacting Evri directly - they advise you call your supplier. Eventually found number to contact Zalando UK to be told have to wait until 5 working days after courier received the goods to initiate a search, so have to call back after 5 working days to get a refund, if no goods. So the onus is on me to chase yet again…….goods hadn’t arrived after 5 working days so phoned again and a refund was issued with a promise that I could buy again at the same price. All of the phone operatives were very helpful within the boundaries of their processes. One hour after this was all sorted, Evri messaged to say they were delivering the goods that day! The goods duly arrived and I called Zalando to pay for them again ………. Eventually resolved and goods are excellent. With the passage of time from a customers perspective waiting 5 working days (7 actual days) longer than the promised delivery date is not satisfactory…… maybe Zalando need to change courier?"
I ordered my item with zalander. The delivery driver sent my item back as the packaging was empty. I contacted zalander to exsplain what happened thay only offered half the price i paid for my item.  Which i didnt recive in first place. No offer to replace my order that i didnt recive. Only half a refund
"I had the same experience as Anindita Ghose below except that once I had verified my account by replying to the email with my details, they subsequently deactivated my entire account without telling or warning me. Needless to say, I complained through customer service and was told that this had been done for my own good. I mentioned that this could've been achieved with a simple password reset rather than account deactivation. If they were going to deactivate anyway, why bother asking me to verify? I have of course now lost access to my entire order history. Since other people have been having this same issue, it seems there are serious security concerns with this website. Avoid if you value your personal information."
very good service cant complain always received items and refunds
"More than five starts from me.Been more than 5 years loyal customer to Zalando, The first option always.Great service, discounts, returning policy and refunds."
Delivery takes a while but worth it for the quality and genuine products which actually meets the description!
Absolutely shocking customer services dept. I have complained three times and telephoned three times this week. Sent chat and e mails and responded to two lots of e mails giving my personal info. This has been requested as it seems my account has been hacked. So I have asked for a simple customer password reset and verified my id to them three times. Every time I respond to their id they send back the same email asking for the same info ! Even the response to a complaints e mail is the same. The telephone agents keep saying they will reset password as soon as I answer three id questions.Shocking if they don’t respond I’m complaining to ombudsman as they have my personal details and have asked for it now so many times.
"I ordered off this website blind as I’d never heard of them before but it was the only place showing stock of the sliders I wanted and I’m due to go away on holiday. Whilst on the site I seen some vans (pumps) that I also like so placed the order. Stupidly afterward I looked at their reviews and most were bad, I started panicking thinking they weren’t going to come. However the following day I received an email saying they were dispatched, I thought great news. I had an email today and all goods were present and they had them to me within 3 day of ordering. So from my experience I’ve gave them a 5* review and would certainly use them again in the future."
I am surprised by the bad reviews as I've been using Zalando for years and I think their customer service is brilliant. They deliver with Hermes/Evri so there can be delays and other issues but the Customer Service is always very responsive and helpful. It's a great site that offers great prices on good quality items.
"Very poor customer service + they are delivering with Evri (who lost my parcel), but Zalando kept me waiting for 2 weeks and in the end told me that they will issue a refund and the agent literally ended the chat.. awful, awful, awful"
"I have made several purchases through Zalando and I haven't been disappointed st all. My recent purchase (order no 10501018495184) which arrived today delivered by a nice lady from Evri/Hermes, was spot on and I am very happy. I bought Ralph Lauren cargo trousers and a couple more pairs from a company called Brave Soul. Everything fits like a glove. I am so pleased. And I am really fussy"
Used to be good. Suddenly having a terrible experience with them!I have shopped with zalando for years and had an excellent service. I have recently placed an order and it's been two weeks. The item is still in 'packing' according to their website. Can't cancel the order and can't get through to anyone in customer service!What a mess!
"Ordered Jordan Point lane Trainer couldn't get them anywhere in my size but Zalando had them.I knew the company is based in Germany.Expected delivery was 25th to 30th july.Received them on the 26th July.Kept me informed all the way.I love these trainers, Thank you ZalandoWill be using you again"
After so many negative reviews I thought I’d share my experience as I too was skeptical. I’ve ordered a pair of suede shoes for a wedding.Order placed Thursday 21st July.Expected delivery was 25th to 29th july.Received 26th July.Cannot fault the company or service one bit.
Zalando cancelled an order after taking payment and claiming to have stock of the item.What worse is that the identical item was being sold on ebay for hald the price.
"almost two weeks since I made my two orders and still no sight of my two pair of shoes...??????and customer service completely useless, they don't know where my parcel is (out for delivery forever, apparently) nor they can tell me if the parcel will ever be delivered! I gave Zalando £350 a two weeks ago but no shoes.... is that a scam or what?"
"Never had a problem with this company. Good quality items at great prices, items arrived in good condition and pretty fast too.People seem to post when they don’t get their items immediately and don’t post when an order goes well.I can absolutely vouch for Zalando’s legitimacy and quality"
"Worst delivery experience of my life!!! No parcel , no refund, no help from customer service!! SHOCKING!!! Why is this company using Evri as a courier !!!!"
Took a few days to dispatch. Customer service seems good gave me reassurance and the info I needed. All in all though the Jordans I ordered turned up on the date estimated and I can also rest assure that they do not sell fakes like most have commented with out proof they sell genuine authentic merch. Very easy to tell just enter the 9 digit serial on the shoes label in at the nike website and you'll see these products are the real deal. Mine also came undamaged so it's safe to say don't always listen to bed reviews some might be putting it on to get products for nothing also people are quick enoigh to right a bad review on a bad exoerience but never a good one. Very well done zalando you made one happy customer here. Keep it up
"BUYER BEWARE IF BUYING A GIFT CARDI was kindly bought three gift cards for my birthday/Christmas.  When I went to redeem them, two scratched off successfully, but the third one didn't,  therefore leaving the voucher code illegible. I sent a photo of the said card accompanied by an email explaining what had happened.  Zalando is refusing to help without a receipt.  I don't have a receipt for the gift card, as it was bought as a gift and it was six months ago.  I do however have the Zalando box that the card came in when presented to me and the card number is visible, just not the voucher code.  The fact that the voucher code completely rubbed off deems this gift card as not fit for purpose and therefore does not comply with The Sale of Goods Act 1974.  The voucher was bought and paid for in good faith, this is quite frankly daylight robbery by Zalando.  Neither good Customer service nor PR.  The customer service team appears to be very inexperienced.  I have purchased quite a bit from Zalando in the last couple of years and I always request gift cards for birthdays etc.  I feel very let down and disappointed, as I am a loyal customer and have been treated very poorly by Zalando."
"Terrible - Do not use.Refused to cancel and order when it had not even been shipped or payment take from my account (transaction was still 'pending' i.e. not claimed by them) as the order had been 'packed' and therefore could not be cancelled. This is in complete contradiction of their legal terms and conditions on their website. Very complaints to them were unanswered and when a response eventually materialised they maintained their position and took money from my account despite my having expressly revoked my authority for them to do so prior to shipping. I will never use this website again, I suggest other people don't either."
"Just received my third order from Zalando. Same excellent service as previous. Item as described, great communication regarding delivery, item delivered within specified time frame."
It is impossible to get in touch with a customer service advisor to resolve issues not listed in their FAQs. They do not respond on social channels either. There is a real issue with giving customer right amount of refunds on returns on a consistent basis. Either they are consciously trying  to cheat customers and hide or they have a terribly broken process and should jot be allowed to trade online in Europe if they cannot meet the legal obligations of returns and refunds properly
"Avoid at all cost! Got the item I ordered on time, however had to send this back due to size. It's been over 3 weeks now and still no refund. Their customer services team are playing with me instead of trying to be helpful. I'll be claiming back a refund from my credit card company as have no other choice at this stage."
"Despite poor reviews - seems nobody reviews when things go right! - and compare all top brands reviews - very similar low scores, order was easy, arrived in time and no issues at all.Will shop again here."
"Took three days to dispatch my order, what a joke!"
Returned trainers to Zalando. Zalando claimed they received used jeans rather than trainers. I queried this and asked Zalando to take it up with the courier as clearly my return had been tampered with. No willingness to investigate. No refund offered. The Hermes tracking number shows the parcel hadn't even been delivered to Zalando so absolutely no idea what happened. Very unfriendly customer service. I'm now out of pocket.
"Fully positive experience, not the fastest shipping and no option to pay more for express but I was in no hurry - trainers arrived in 5 working days. Wanted to offset some of the negative reviews."
"Really poor, second bad experience from this company. I bought items x3 recently, which were in the 20% off sale.  Two weeks later and no parcel. I called tonight and the customer service rep said “oh sorry, problems in the warehouse delivering parcel to our couriers, we will refund you and you can buy again”. I go to buy the items again but no sale. Is it really fair to make me pay full price, no discount because of their warehouse issues? Awful."
"Ordered a Nike golf polo , came within 3 days of ordering free delivery no issues , was a little nervous at first with all the bad reviews but I had a good experience"
"Ordered from zalando before, usually ok..but have had one experience of a pair of air force ones turning up with a dent in them that I ended up having to keep because they said I could reorder but despite saying that I couldn't readd the product to the basket..which I told them..they ignored so I ended up keeping. Today, two pairs of air force ones have turned up with scuffs on them and brown marks..form for claims doesn't work..so I rang up. Assistant redirected me to the form which was not helpful. Definitely will think twice about using zalando now. Not sure what to do about the shoes. Very disappointed."
Fake Dr Martens - (and bad fakes at that!)
"Oh my gosh I used to think very highly of this company but the customer service is basically non existent. I called three times, I always spoke to the same women who didn't know how to answer any of my questions ands when the website autocorrected my address and removed the house number she said she can't change it but also I couldn't cancel the order either. Very disappointing that a company like this cannot be more helpful."
"Nothing short of dreadful, four failed collections and apparently there is not a manager in Zalando who can write or call you. Customer service team cannot be bothered to read the emails, no apology or goodwill gesture to compensate for my time making endless phone calls and sending endless emails nor for my time or petrol when I have to find a parcel shop to send my return.In short -Terrible customer service - team can only sense check emails and answer the parts they want to - AVOID."
"I can't speak for anyone else who have left poor reviews, but my own personal experience with Zalando was brilliant. Bought a pair of Asics trainers that, with a money off voucher, were almost £20 cheaper than anywhere else I could find, and they arrived withing the estimated time frame (which was free delivery too)."
"Purchased adidas predator football boots for my sons birthday from these clowns. Turned up and before I opened the box I could smell them! Upon opening I found a smelly, damaged used pair of boots with a big hole in the side. These had clearly been worn several times, why the sent them out is mind blowing (but from reading other complaints I now see they’ve done it to plenty of others). Contacted customer services by phone 3 times and they couldn’t care less (return and we’ll investigate) tried the Twitter customer service, even worse! I have followed their return process, can see from the tracking they’ve had the boots a week and haven’t heard a word or had my refund and groveling apology yet. I also submitted a complaint via the webform and got copy and paste replies designed to grind you down and detract you from complaining. I left a review of the product on their website and surprising (shock horror) it wasn’t published - funny that. If I could give them a plus it would be that their customer service avoidance tactics are top notch!"
I am totally disgusted returned a whole order and refunded for half.  No contact details on the website and the links don’t work.  Total scam! AVOID
"You can’t buy any product here.. I tried, but the “buy” button becames red right after I clicked on it. This shop is most likely scam, so be careful!"
I ordered sandals and was worried as I had read reviews. I wanted to chase up tracking and customer service was very helpful. Sandals arrived on the day shown. I must say I am delighted with sandals and got them at a good price. I would have no hesitation shopping here again
"I buy many things from Zalando and the delivery is reliant.The lovely clothes, super shoes are my go to and sometimes the UK sizing can be different to US but their returns are easy with no hassle.Super assortment, good quality.Great for Christmas gifts.Happy customer."
I was worried as my parcel was being shipped from abroad and I read the reviews thinking I'll never get it.  It arrived on time and was a great price so one very happy customer.
"I keep saying this, Zalondo has got to be the worst company ever. I have over 500 pounds worth of refunds they have not refunded me back and I honestly think it’s disgusting as a company. I’m honestly going to sue them because they can’t keep getting away with these behaviours. DREADFUL, STAY AWAY."
"I said to myself if my clothes don't arrive by Friday before the weekend (as stated) I will leave a 1 star review, but they did arrive on time surprisingly using Evri (the UKs infamous worst delivery service) so, fair play Zalando"
"Excellent service, great website and free delivery/returns. What's not to like!"
Order still showing as waiting. Whatever that means. Could Zalando let me know something as was a gift it’s order : 10501018360909
"Do not order from here. We placed an order for Nike trainers, no mention of being seconds or damaged. Turned up and they were terrible quite clearly selling seconds which manufacturers can’t sell. Sent them back for a refund and confirmed  that they had been revived. Spent 30 mins arguing with customer service as to why they have a 14 day refund policy, after the fact that they have miss-sold us damaged goods. Out of pocket for £120 and 3 weeks later still waiting for a refund…do yourself a favour and pay the extra £10 and ovoid these crooks at all costs"
Impossible to contact customer services. awaiting a refund 2 weeks after returning item. unacceptable services
Absolutely shocking refund policies. Be careful ordered from their partners such as Mango and other. Those refunds will never make it..
"Very bad service, avoid for Your own good! Order placed but not delivered due to ""parcel quality not good enough to be delivered""... after going on live chat been told to make new order and price match will be made cause new order for same items was more expensive and I couldn't use 10£ voucher on new order because I used it on previous one. Second order placed and arrived, after getting in touch with customer service to ask about refund been told that they can't do the price match for price difference which was 12.01£ they can do refund for 4£ only. That was like a joke to me. PLEASE AVOID! Cause You gonna lose money and they don't care about You even if it's their fault!"
"I've spent over a month so far without luck trying to get my money back for a return through Hermes that has gone missing in transit on it's way back to the factory. From looking at other reports here this isn't an uncommon occurrence. Hermes has always been dreadful, surely when things go wrong this frequently you fix the problem by moving to another carrier!The support staff over the phone just sound limited in being able to help at all. Surely after two investigations have been issued something has to be found as wrong... Have been without upwards of £1,000 worth of clothes and the payment for over a month now!"
Was almost put off by some negative reviews and wondered if site/ product was genuine. Ordered and glad I did. Item had a brilliant discount and was delivered before it was scheduled to be. Great service.
"The situation is absurd. Placed and order for Ray-Ban Marshall sunglasses. Received them, unpacked and was very disappointed. Never thought that sunglasses can be sent like this, with no damage prevention, as they were just laying on the bottom of the box with protection placed on top of them, but nothing below. But that is not the worst thing. I payed 154 euros for the sunglasses and based on my research I have received a clone (I think it is a brand called ICON which are a cheap clones of Ray-Ban sunglasses for about 30 euros). I did contact customer care, they did send me a letter requesting to fill in the form with my complaint. Did it this morning and called them at the end of the day to ask what is happening as I am stuck with a cheap pair of sunglasses with no information what is next. During a call I was told that this should be sorted out maybe next week. When asked can I talk with someone more senior as I do not like to wait for so long I was told that there is no one else to speak with. This situation is so frustrating that it is beyond me. A mistake is done by Zalando and I am not able to get a proper answer when what and how?At first I even thought that it is a fake Ray-Ban, but as mentioned it seems they do sell some brand called ICON. I had to do my own research as Zalando seems to not care that much, as customer care specialist said to me - they have a process which they need to follow. So rather than sending me Ray-Ban sunglasses they did send these cheap once. Now I am waiting for a resolution, but it seems they do not care that much. Maybe that is a standard they have."
"Why does the refund process take 14 days or longer, after Zalando receive the returned goods?"
"for the second time my return parcel has gone missing in transit, so called customer service they gave me forms to fill it out, i did all what they have asked, so now its been 30 days i am trying to chase my refund, calling customer service every day, and its all the same answer you case was sent out to higher department so only thing that we can do now is just chase them up for the answer, and there is no exact time frame when they do that, they are extremely busy!!!!"
After reading loads of bad reviews- I decided to see for myself (usually I would run a mile) and purchased a CK bag - usually £90 but bought for £49.The very same handbag was for sale in the House of Frasier for £65. From start to finish it was easy with excellent customer service and great communication - arrived before scheduled date. If you are put off with all the bad reviews- just try itAs yet I can’t comment on buying clothes
"Honestly, I used to love Zalando. I bought from them a lot and for a while had good and quick customer service. Not sure what has changed on their end but their courier lost my return in transit and I’ve been chasing my refund for months. Their customer service team made me fill out a form with personal information and send a photo of my ID as if I was in the wrong and even after that, haven’t been responded to for a month. I’ve been in contact since late April. I’ve been in customer service for large companies before so I know how it can be. I’ve been as “patient and understanding” as I could have been but I’m fed up at being blatantly ignored and having my refund kept from me."
"Ordered a pair of shoes and when they arrived they were a completely different pair to what I ordered! I’m more upset that the original shoes I ordered are now sold out that anything, really disappointed :("
"Do not use it! Terrible company ,they’ve no clue how to operate…They sent an email to confirm a refund and the refund never happened….The return service is not working as parcels get lost on the way back …I have already lost my mine for two orders…Avoid !!!"
"My order hasn't arrived despite paying £3.99 for delivery. It was meant to arrive today, although it seems it wasn't even handed to Evri yet. Shame that they don't inform about delays and use Evri as their provider which causes more delays due to their incompetence. Customer service, although nice, cannot do anything helpful. It was impossible to reach the complaints department."
DISGRACE - do not order from Zalando. They take your money and never send the item
Absolutely awful experience! I'm dealing with a customer support team who is not capable of neither reading nor doing simple math. Been asking for a refund for weeeeekkkss and they keep asking me the same questions. Because they don't know how to read nor count I've been getting pieces of refunds there and then. It's a total nightmare! You would think that its easy to take the total of the order minus what has not been returned and refund the difference!!!
"I have found so many bad reviews about that company. Especially about refunds.  However I never had any problems at all. Always got good items,not to long to wait for delivery and ones I've got wrong size item so received refund quicker than expected."
I ordered some sunglasses costing £80. When I opened the package I had an empty cardboard box with no sunglasses to be found! When I phoned to complain they immediately refunded me despite me telling them I still wanted the glasses. Now they are priced at £114 so I'm out of pocket because of their mistake. Ordinarily I would just go elsewhere but I had £75 worth of vouchers with them so had no choice. Really poor customer service and I won't be shopping with them again.
"I was very wary of ordering from this site from reading the reviews. I eventually decided to risk it and ordered a pair of Converse shoes as I could not get them anywhere. I had to pay £3.99 delivery, however I ordered on Thursday and the parcel arrived the following Monday. I don't think many companies would be able to offer such quick service."
"Awesome Nike sneakers, great price and delivery on time, super happy customer."
"Awful. Spent 62 on a bag. Had for less than two months and had barely been used. The stitching came off on the thing that keeps handle on. I asked for a replacement or refund. Given a 21.60 refund? Ridiculous. The bag is defective. The handle didn't even rip, it just came away casually so it's hardly my fault. Disgusting."
"Worst customer expirience, when some one hack your account and change email game over, they wont return the account to you the block it and you loose all ur history data as well as wish list ..."
"I received my item on time. It was the correct item and was discounted at a very good price. I was worried after reading the reviews. Either I was lucky, or the negative reviews are fake or the company has done something to address the negative reviews."
"Parcel hasn’t arrived, 3 days late now, have been told to wait another 3 working days before “complaining”All the customer service team did was blame the courier and I they didn’t even attempt to keep my custom so won’t be using them again. Don’t blame a courier that YOU chose to use. Everyone knows Hermes/Evri are awful."
"this is one of the worst ever companies I dealt with in my entire life, I had to call the customer service twice, once to get an update about my item, and then after a week I have to call back again, and surprisingly the customer service team told me that I have to cancel the order, I was like so why not you called me before to inform me that you sold me an item that you don't have instore. I am not happy at all, I have to delete my account and stop ordering anything from this company"
Last week I placed my first ever order with Zalando.Ordered two shirts.Both articles arrived as advertised within a week.Extremely happy with the prices and service.
"I ordered some trainers at an excellent price, then read the reviews on here and started to worry.....but, no need, Zalando have been spot on, delivery was a few days and my trainers arrived on the earliest day of their estimate.I am very happy and will order from them again."
Don’t order from this company full crooks they send me wrong item then they felt it ok customer to make loads calls they feel 20 cent discount put it right they want me spend other 40 pounds to get it what insight taken this matter papers today as feel it ok upset Disablity customers have no care in world
I read the reviews on here before ordering and nearly didn’t bother however I wanted some sandals last minute for my holiday and they were sold out everywhere else. I am so glad I ordered from this site. The sandals came earlier than estimated and are perfect. Good condition and good email communication to update me on the status of my order. Would definitely order from this site again.
"Wouldn't use again, ordered trainers one trainer was clearly not new ( wish i could add pictures), had stains all over it and scuff marks, poor is an understatement"
Excellent experience with this company. Very good value and received quickly.
Never known so much waiting time for a delivery it’s been over two weeks Not good
My account was hacked and the customer support was not able to provide any help.Please avoid sharing your personal details with this company as it's very unsecure.
"Was skeptical at first due to the reviews but noticed roughly 95% of the negative ones were people wanting to return items so that gave me confidence knowing the item will be delivered as I knew I didn’t want to return the item. I ordered some Gucci sunglasses and have to say I’m very pleased with them and the whole process, good communication, quick delivery, tracking details provided and reasonably priced. Give them a try as some of the reviews are misleading."
I was seriously shocked when I saw some bad reviews on here!!! I’ve been using zalando for years and I’ve never had a problem. I’ve made plenty of returns and always had the money refunded with the time frame. I got asked the other day if this site was fake due to the bad reviews on here!! NO it isn’t!!
"so slow to send goods and unhelpful customer service , will never get another order from me !"
"I used to live in Berlin and bought a lot from Zalando. Now im in the UK and I'm guessing Brexit has impacted the company, cos the service is pretty different. I put an order in on 27th June and four days later, it's still not even being processed. Orders take ages. I know this is may not be the company's fault, but maybe it should warn UK customers that deliveries will always take a while because of Brexit. Also the customer service is not great here - I was palmed off by an assistant after trying to get a refund paid to a different bank account. It was a long conversation and she understood and was taking my details then suddenly mid- chat she said ""send an email cos I might make a mistake if you dictate the details"". Which was really annoying! I emailed them and got no response. I'm guessing Zalando is just better all round if you're based in Germany."
"Very disappointed with Zalando's delivery service.I ordered 3 parcels from Zalando in the last 2 weeks. For each of these, I received an email from Evri stating that the item has been delivered. I did not receive a single one of these parcels. For the first parcel after much complaints they eventually tracked down my parcel and sent it to me. For the second one, they stated that their GPS was not accurate at time of delivery and they need to declare it lost. I still have not heard back from them regarding the third parcel. Shocking service - very disappointed."
"Bad customer service...not helpful at all!!!!Be careful at their return policy...They are quite ""picky"" as a matter of speaking....Hard to understand them!"
"I'm not reviewing my recent experience, but about 5 years worth! I've never, never, had a problem with Zalando...! Great customer service, great return service and they are pretty much my go-to shopping choice!"
"Really bad experience, sent two coats back worth £400 they said they hadn’t received. They clearly have as we have the tracking at this end to say it has, even the gps of the location which our postman kindly got for us!Do not shop with company unless you want robbing blind and are prepared to start court proceedings for refunds! Absolute joke and disgrace of a company!"
"I can honestly say your app is the worse I have ever used. I have been trying to buy Jordan’s for my daughters 15th birthday. They are in stock, your customer services have confirmed this yet I can’t add them to my bag to check out. I had the same issue yesterday with Nike dunks. Your website stated the launch was yesterday at 08.35 yet your customer service agent said it’s tomorrow. Guess what, your Instagram page still says yesterday. Zalando is a complete waste of time."
Found a good deal on some sunglasses. Very nearly bought at a more expensive price elsewhere due to the low trustpilot score but decided to risk it. It proved a very smooth purchase - very happy.
"I order a veja from Zalando, long story short i received it in a dirty condition that i had to washed it (dumb when you had to wash ur new shoes right). And when i started to wear it, it is the most uncomfortable shoes ive tried. I kept wearing it since i thought it will get better only to find out that is not. Today i bought the new one from Harrods, i was surprised to find out that the box is noticeably different from the one from Zalando. And this one is waay waay more comfortable (like lots of my friends told me that veja is supposed to be very comfy). Its a shame that Zalando is simply a scam. I should've seen the reviews before i bought the item, turns out im not the only one. I guess now is way too late to return the item since its been worn out. I will just leave this review from my own experience here. Dont waste your money and time on this website. They claimed to only sell genuine item, well genuinely fake."
I ordered a jacket 2 weeks ago. The courier lost it; I’m still waiting for the refund from Zalando.I’m very disappointed with their poor customer service. I’ll never buy clothing from Zalando Uk. I contacted them 6 times and I’m wasting my time.
They scam you if you have to return and get refund.  I'm stocked  at my experience with them please avoid.I was scammed by zalando
"Order a bag for my daughter's bday on the 5th April for a shop collection. Got an email on the 9th saying it's ready to collect. Shop staff couldn't find it and not on their system either. Went back two more times on different weeks as it says it's ready for collection, but still not there. I emailed them about the problem. Got a reply on the 16th informing me that they are ""investigating"" and was told I will get an update on the 24th. That was it! Didn't heard anything from Zalando CS, no calls or email and no refund at all, its now 18th of May still no communication from them. Luckily I have found a different bag for my LD. I will think twice before ordering from Zalando again. They don't deserve your hard earned money."
"I completed my return incorrectly, after explaining what when wrong, guys really paid a massive effort to find it, and I’ve got my refund straight after. Appreciate as it was my mistake."
I have ordered a pair of Jordans. Delivery was quick and on time. I didn’t like the colours when i tried the shoes on so i decided to return. The return process was easy and quick. After the return was confirmed i got my refund. I ordered another pair of Jordans in colours i loved. They arrived quickly and on time too. Great service from Zalando.
Ordered a pair of expensive sunglasses and they lost them. They offered me a refund and a 15% off voucher but the sunglasses had gone up so much that even with the voucher they were still more expensive than when I initially ordered them. They refused to better the price despite the inconvenience.
"What has happened to Zalando?! They have always been so quick at delivering and refunding. Not anymore. I returned an expensive item via the dreaded Hermes/Evri 1 week ago and its still not been delivered back to Zalando - Zalando's reply is ""you need to wait 14 days before we anything to help"" WOW - what thoroughly unhelpful customer service. This will be my last purchase from them. Raising a case with PayPal now............"
"My order didn't arrive even though it gave an estimate of 4-5 days. Now they said wait 2 days more if still, the same problem occurs we will refund you. What kind of service is this. I needed that piece and now I won't be able to have the item with me. I do not recommend this site to anyone. WORST SITE IN THE UK"
"More than happy, good products all the time, good sale as well,  good customer service."
"Purchased a nice pair of Buffalo Boots which developed a fault, they're not exactly cheap so requested a warranty return. Got an email back to make a ""claim"" and was refunded a small portion of the cost of the product.That is not acceptable as the item is covered by a warranty and who needs a partial refund for a faulty product when the law says either repair, exchange or refund - in that order of preference.Will update this review appropriately depending how this develops."
"I have been in contact with Zalando 5 times for a return label for massimo dutti as it's a partner item and it's been well over a month since they promised to send it to me. Now I'm over the 100 day return policy so they try to tell me massimo dutti refuses to issue the return label. That's None of my business as I have been in contact with you well before the 100 days were up!! Customer service is useless, asked to speak to the manager, told me they're in a meeting and will get back to me later on in the day... I searched the other reviews, it seems like this exact thing has happened to alot of other people ! Literally the worst company ever, absolute scammers!!!"
"Ordered a pair of trainers I've wanted for ages, but it got lost in transit with Evri/Hermes. They knew it was lost but hadn't let me know until past the delivery date. Zalando customer service wouldn't send me the shoes out again as they have gone up in price and only offered a refund. Not great customer service from Zalando..."
"Mate, look at your Trustpilot reviews, Evri partnerships is destroying your brand. I haven't received my parcel. Still waiting"
"I saw this company had a poor rating from 30 per cent of 4500 ratings. It had a good rating from 60 per cent of people. Perhaps it is worth noting that this company has a 10 billion euro turnover across Europe and a 1 million a day turnover in the UK. So if an average sale is £200 that would be 5000 sales a day in the UK, or more  sales per day than reviews on here over several years. My own experience with the company was good, they delivered the products I ordered on time via Evr. The prices were excellent and the postage was free. Reading through the reviews a lot of people are serial slaters, only ever giving bad reviews, one person bought 20 pairs of shoes with the intention of returning 18 pairs - seriously. The reality is you can't beat clothes shopping in the high street, because you can see what you are going to get. The problem is that people are only likely to give bad reviews because they are annoyed and not bother giving good reviews if things are good. Therefore the probability is that more than 99.5 per cent of people are happy."
So you are telling me I stayed awake to order Jordan ones but the second they release. There out of stock. What. A joke I’m sure those reseller used bots and took every thing
Don't trust this company keep away. Return my item back because it was damaged. They're not willing to refund or send my item back. How stupid is that is. So I contact my bank and I got my money back. This company don't ever trust this company to be honest with you
"Avoid! Zalando did not return my money for the goods returned in January (i have proof of delivery from Royal mail), £318.80.As a matter of fact, they blackmail me into providing a copy of my passport and my signature in addition to my name and address. According to the Zalando policy, the money should be back into my account within 14 days. There is no mention of providing sensitive personal details on the Zalando website.I asked the police, and they said that it is a direct violation of GDPA as Zalando refuses to provide me with a reason why a copy of my passport and signature is required and what Zalando is going to do with my data. When I asked directly, I was told: ""I am sorry if our request for a copy of your ID has upset you. That is certainly not our intention."" The irony!Four (4!!!) months later, I am still waiting for my money. If you know how I can escalate the matter, I will be really grateful for the info. I think my only option now is to go through the small claims court process.PS Nathalie Beves from Zalando, who requested sensitive information without justification, hope you have a good day."
"I returned both items and only received a refund for one item (GAP Sherpa fleece). Both items were returned on the same day and at the same place - see receipt.The receipt showed that Hermes was used and it was on 3rd March 2022.It has now been 2 months since it has been returned and I have yet to receive a refund, despite all the evidence given. I have been in back-and-forth communication with Zalando and have received repeat replies or attempts to avoid investigating the package.As this is a package that has already been returned, the customer legally has no responsibility over packages that are lost during transit. This is an issue that should be discussed with Hermes and Zalando as there is insurance for this.Regardless of the small cost, it is a matter of principle that I should receive a refund for an item that I returned (with proof) and this company has been consistently stretching this process at every turn.This is by far the worst experience I've had with an online seller and I've shopped at various retailers. I will never use Zalando ever again, and I suggest everyone avoid it if possible."
i ordered some vapourmaxs evo and they sent me a plain brown box! not original nike box at all and i tried to return but they wont let me and now i cant even sell them to stock x as it is not original box so i would avoid this store. Awful.
"Beware!Read the negative reviews before you shop here. I've never written a review but felt compelled to because their services are so horrible and scammy. They haven't issued my refund and say I will not be refunded unless I sign a legal document and send in my ID. This sounds very scammy and is pure theft if I won't be refunded. I should send in my ID to their customer service email which all of their customer service reps have access to. This is not a safe way to send your ID and gives a high chance for GDPR data breach and having your information leaked or stolen.I have talked to multiple agents all of whom are unable to help or more so unwilling to help. When asking why they need this document they end the chat or hang up the phone. I spoke to one agent on the phone for a few minutes. When I explained to her that it was theft if I did not get my refund she actually pretended to go through a tunnel and hung up. Then sent an email apologizing for bad connection.I've gotten differing answers when they will delete your ID from their system. Everywhere from immediately and 14 days.I've also gotten differing answers as to why they need my ID to process a refund. These include 'start the investigation with the authorities and maybe with the police' and also 'your bank has asked us for your proof of identity'. First of all if they need to do any investigation into why I haven't received my refund. That investigation starts internally and my ID should not be needed for that. Secondly, your bank has asked us for your ID for proof of identity?!? I think this is probably the first line in the book for dummies on how to scam people.I replied to the email where they were asking for my ID and legal document with all the inconsistencies I have received from them. I also cc'd their privacy policy team and legal team in on this. As zalando workers are telling me blatant lies and expect me to send them my passport. I was told I should get a reply to my email by a certain date. That date passed but no reply. I started a new chat and the agent that connected was the one that sent me the email, a guy named Patrick. I asked if he would reply to my email. He told me he had seen my email but said that he would not respond to my email unless I sent in my ID and legal form. How unprofessional?I hope the workers at Zalando feel good about themselves helping this company scam and steal money from people.I'm really at a loss for words how utterly unprofessional this company is. Basically I have the option of not sending my passport to them and not receive my refund. Or send them my passport and have my data and information compromised. This is so absurd. If I will not send them my passport I will not get my money back. This sounds like extorsion does it not?All in all. Beware of this company if you don't want your money stolen."
"I believe the “Levi’s” jeans I have bought are fake/counterfeit. I have exactly the same pair I had previously purchased from Levi’s direct and side by side, the Zalando ones are awful. Cheap denim, completely the wrong colour, terrible stitching, the seams are uneven on each leg and are not straight, even the labels are the same but the fonts incorrect. Overall they feel disgusting. Be very wary of purchasing from here…this was my once and only."
I've ordered and paid for a pair of trainers I never received had countless emails with someone by the name of pica cook been asked to fill in eforms in order to recieve my goods or money back I've done that still getting asked for more information get the feeling its so I give up I have money gone done buy of zolando ever!!!!!
The return is a pain. The first time they didnt pick up the return and the second time the return label they included in my order didnt scan for the courier. Constant problems and condescending attitude.
Selling counterfeit Versace. Beware!!!!
One of the worst orders ever I ordered a zavetti jacket it said it would come to 3/5 days it came after 2 weeks that’s not even the bad part the bad part was two of the zip buttons were missing the second I opened it I will not be using Zalando again and I recommend to anyone not to use it
"I am surprised at the negative reviews as recently ordered boots at a value of over £350 as they were the only company I could buy them. They arrived quickly, beautifully packed but unfortunately didn't fit. I returned them and received my refund within 10 days. So I have to say I was quite satisfied and somewhat relieved!"
"I was worried about purchasing from Zalando after seeing some of the reviews, but my experience was okay. I wanted some trainers that were difficult to find in the wide fit size, ZalandoI got £10 off my first order which was a big bonus. The trainers took a while to be dispatched, and arrived a day or two after the later end of the delivery window, but they arrived in good condition.I changed my mind about the trainers, and organised a return online. There was a return label included in the package, but I was able to return it via courier collection for free if I organised the return online. The return was tracked and I received my refund.No complaints."
"Dreadful. Worst online experience I’ve had for a long time. Delivery going to take well over 10 days and “can’t cancel because it’s already been shipped”, even though the courier doesn’t have the parcel yet?Can’t operate like this in 2022. Catch up quick"
"Can you explain how it takes your delivery partner 3 days to even accept the delivery from you?I won't be using Zalando again until you change your delivery company, everytime I order it takes over three days for them to even ""recieve"" the parcel from you..If you are an online company, sure speed of delivery is pretty important? Utter rubbish!!I ordered on the 12th and it's the 15th and still not even been dispatched or with your delivery partner!!"
Would give zero if possible!Customer service is awful & not helpful!Also keep finding product cheaper elsewhere! Deliveries never turn up on time & customer service won’t let you cancel the order. Also have put a couple of negative reviews about zalando service & of course they didn’t post them! Honestly go elsewhere!
"I purchased a pair of trainers from Zalando, and when they arrived they were dirty and scratched. I immediately contacted Zalando and filled in the claims form they requested, ensuring I attached clear photos of the damage. I explained that I was travelling abroad the following day, to which they responded they were unwilling to rectify their error as I was unable to return the trainers until my return in 3 months time. This is a breach of Consumer Contracts Regulations and Consumer Rights Act, which say that if an item is received in faulty condition then the buyer has the right to a refund or replacement within 6 months of purchase. I highlighted their error and informed them that their breach of Regulations had been reported - at that point they stopped responding to my emails. Their contact system is also abysmal. Instead of being able to respond to their emails, you need to open a whole new query via their website each time you want to reply, over complicating the process and leaving you explaining yourself repeatedly to different members of staff."
"Terrible service! after using their pickup courier service. Have been waiting for a refund for over 14 days now and yet I was promised it would be escalated at every conversation. No one can tell me what has happened, and I've had to sign a legal statement form to boot... AVOID"
"Absolutely terrible.  Placed an order for 3 identical items.  All 3 arrived and I didn't like the design so I sent them back. This was one order (quantity of 3) in 1 parcel.  When they received my return, they refunded 1 item only!  When I noticed and raised this with customer service they were rude and unhelpful and provided no explanation as to how 1 single parcel with all the items in 1 order could be split like this.  CHECK YOUR REFUNDS! I AM CERTAIN THIS IS A PRACTICE TAKING PLACE REGULARLY AND MANY HAVE LOST REFUNDS BUT HAVEN'T NOTICED! NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN!"
"4 days ago I placed an order, they have not even shipped it yet. I'm sorry, but there is absolutely no excuse, it's 2022, and this joke of an outfit can't even make a delivery in reasonable time. Last time they have any of my money.Edit: 4 days later and sill not shipped."
"The product came as advertised, in perfect condition and was delivered within the time frame promised. All other online retailers on the continent didn’t have it in my size, but they stocked the item in all sizes. Was quite impressed. Will use them again…"
"Zalando is not the fastest when it comes to delivery but I can put up with that. Their return process, however, is so painfully long and tedious. Better shop elsewhere."
"Experience has been the worst, colleagues on customer support have been useless and till this day I have not received my refund for the items I returned a month ago. They have always been telling me I would get my refund and always prostponed the date however they have just stole my money. I would not recommend to anyone"
First time I’ve bought from this website. Goods were supposed to have been shipped 6 days ago. Evri tracking shows they still don’t have them. The link for customer services on the Zalando website is a blind link that does nothing. Got onto the chat service and they acknowledge and then do nothing. Will never use Zalando again.
"Ordered 10 days ago. Should of arrived 6 days ago. When I track it it says waiting for zalando to dispatch. When I check the order on zalando it says order dispatched 6 days ago. I have emailed, rang and used the chat bot with no luck. Not sure how I progress from here"
"Shocking service. Purchased a pair of trainers for my girlfriend that have been very hard to come by, only for my order to be cancelled without the basic courtesy of telling me why. I won’t be using this company again and will be advising others to follow suit."
Very fast delivery very happy can’t fault at all
"Last two orders I've made were never delivered, even though they were shipped. They just got send  back to zalando without any reason. The support said ""they can't disclose the reason"" why this has happen and I need to re-order again. No thanks!! Don't use this company"
"Last 2 orders have been cancelled on zalando's side with no email notifying me this had been done. Poor customer service, don't recommend."
"I placed an order and all was normal until I read the reviews on here ....I wasn't too worried as I paid by PayPal, so accepted that I may have issues (based on the other reviews)..... I received an email this morning saying item may be delayed and please do not contact them.I thought the reviews must be right, however item was delivered today (Wednesday) and I ordered it last Friday.... so no problems for me whatseoverAll good !"
"I placed an order on March 27th which was supposed to arrive in 3-5 days and it didn't come until today and it shows that the package didn't reach the Jews, I can't give customer service for 3 days, I wrote on Instagram no one  answer, virtual assistant said the service does not work, and they said to wait by email, so it works very badly, too bad they have a lot of beautiful clothes and shoes, contact me and check the status of the Zolando order !!!  If.  Read this review"
Ordered a pair of shoes order was being prepared for 3 days when purchased said delivery date was 3 days got in contact with them and response was not good and rude telling me I should of paid more to get on that date there wasn't a option of getting it sooner and to be fair the 3 day delivery was good enough but hasn't even been shipped after 3 days attitude was all wrong once I receive them would not order from them again spent over 100 pounds to have some half wit be rude to me isn't happening
Delivered different product. Refused to change it. supper rude in the email and after I send it back to them they failed to return the money.
Asked their customer services about not being able to add items to basket. They say it is just a technical glitch. Then contacting them a couple of days later to be told it was actually never in stock.
Extremely unprofessional and unhelpful. I received an email from the courier to say I will receive my parcel today. I waited at home for the package to arrive as I have had a bad experience with the courier services previously and didn’t want to miss the delivery. I called Zalando to inform them that my parcel had not been delivered- all they could do was apologise and tell me to wait a few more days to allow my parcel to arrive. They should at least have some sort of compensation for wasting peoples time and clearly they don’t communicate with the courier services and help get you an update regarding your delivery like other companies. Waste of time- don’t bother as the customer service is so poor. I will update my review if and when I receive my package.
"The quality of the products is great, whenever I have used them. Furthermore, they have also beaten prices on some technology I have bought from the copany. The 3 star rating is because of slow returns process and buggy website functionality at times."
"This website appears to show quite a few recent 5* reviews which has encouraged me to buy from them. Unfortunately, the experience has fallen short of the service I have come to expect.  I purchase a pair of shoes from them on the 27th of February 2022.  It is now been more than a month since purchase and I am still waiting.  Hopefully this review will wake them up.  I will edit my review on its progress.UPDATE:  Refund finally processed.  No apology provided therefore 1* rating remains."
Terrible!!!Items go missing in the post by the courier! Tracked items that stated returning to sender with no reason.Zalando washed there hands with it and said ill be refunded once the items are returned. 4 weeks still and out of pocket waiting for a refund.Zakeri who was the point of contact was no help and basically said its out of his hands and ended chat. Very unprofessional and not fair.They wouldn't even resend the items knowing that it was a issue with them or the courier.
"Bought two pairs of Nike react vision at Xmas, in less than a few months both pairs were faulty, material came apart. Zalando’s customer service was the best I’ve experienced, responsive in minutes, collected the shoes and refunded within a week"
Robbed meWasted my timeBeen over a month since returned item and not Been refunded !Must be poor robbing from average joe
"Zalando uses rare items (that they never had in stock) to get you to sign up for Zalando Plus. I had signed up to Plus to get early access to a pair of Air Jordan 1 in Psychic Purple (somewhat rare color for women). They said the drop would happen 30 March 2022 @9:15am for Plus members. I became a member and was on the site since 9:00am waiting for the drop. At 9:15am the item immediately became ""sold out"" in all sizes. I suspect they never had stock of this item and used it to get people to sign-up. They had advertised consecutive drops that week for the AJ 1 sneakers but the same thing happened with the other colors (the sneakers are now removed from the site). VERY DISAPPOINTED! SCAM!"
"They have a massive choice of shoes and other items, but their customer service sucks. I got Nike shoes, wear them for 3 days, and the shoe started to change its structure, I think it was a defect by Nike itself. Sent them back to Zalando, and they refuse to return me the money because shoes were used. WHAT F... HELL..."
"EDIT:  well I turned in the forms and proof of delivery, and received email back stating a refund issued.  I will leave my original 2 star review below, but the return ended up being pretty painless. Seems Hermes lost the package?  IDK, but it worked ok.   Adjusted my review accordingly.Original:I purchased quite a few things from Zalando and have been very happy with the goods.  HOWEVER, as others have noted, I am having a difficult time getting a refund for items returned.  It seems to be the same story as everyone else.  I have just filled out their form and send all information to them, except for a copy of my photo ID with a signature and expiry date.  I have NEVER been asked for that information before to return items and I am not comfortable sending it to random people via email.  We will see how this pans out, but I will not be buying from them again."
"I returned Massimo Dutti leggings to Zalando worth 299 pounds 2 weeks ago and am yet to receive a refund. There is also no communication from the company regarding returns and receipt of the item you send back. (The only reason I know it is in the warehouse is by checking the delivery tracking reference.)There is no way to raise a return ticket and as such, impossible for the customer to know if someone in the warehouse has stolen the item - rather than log it in a system and receipt back into stock.Wish I had seen all of the bad reviews before I purchased the item. This entire process has been a waste of time and money."
"Please see the updated response below. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!Zalando used to be good. Not anymore!!The quality of service you get has massively deteriorated.I have been trying to obtain refund for more than £500 worth of items I returned more than 20 days ago and they are still not issuing me this. I've sent them legal agreements, return receipt and ID. Everything they required, yet their customer support is struggling issuing the refund.Apart from bad customer support, the quality of items has also gone down. If the quality was good, I wasn't going to return these items.....So despite having a good start, Zalando has become like any other retailer now....UPDATE: DIRECT QUOTE FROM ZALANDO SUPPORT: ""Yes, but as of now the investigation is really on going and we cannot give any exact date for the investigation date to be done. If you don't have any other concerns, I will now end this chat.""Customer agent called ""Shai"". He just closed the chat without any support to me."
"Asked for a delivery to be stopped before it was picked up by the courier. They still delivered, with no proof of identity just onto the porch of my old address. They were useless at communicating- spent arduous hours of my life I won't get back- as well as loosing a £90 item."
"I've been using Zalando very successfully for many years now, but they've suddenly gone down hill very fast. There is no longer a customer service contact option anywhere on their site anymore and they have since shutdown their telephone customer service too. All emails are ""no reply"", so there is no way to contact them that way either.  All published links to ""contact us"" and ""help"" go nowhere.Today's organised return never took place with Evri, (the forever horrendous Hermes hiding under a new name). It's now as impossible to contact Zalando as it is with Evil Evri!It was good while it lasted, Zalando, but I won't be returning my custom now as you have forgotten how to treat your customers."
"I ordered a coat and it was delivered ok. However, the return process is not good. I have had to chase three times so far and am being told the 'warehouse has not received' the parcel. Customer service reply to questions but the process is long and they require photo ID, not just the proof of return. Then a legal form and no information on timeframe.I would avoid using Zalando - it's not worth the significant hassle"
Great items good price and delivered promptly I’m shocked that this company has a few one star reviews as I’ve bought twice in the last month and no problems at all
"Absolutely shocking customer service.Honestly, I would advise anyone to not use this company. It seems like a scamI returned items over 4 weeks ago and still haven't had a refund. I chased it up and they asked me to sign some weird legal form to say I sent the items back. Asked me send a photo of my driving license but didn't tell me what their data processing rules are.I was told 2 weeks ago that I'd be updated in a week but wasn't. I have to keep chasing. All I get told is they're looking into it.As others have reported on here they've had similar issues.Do not use this company. I think all signs pointing to this company being a scam.Also the quality of the good are very poor. I've had several pair of levi jeans from there with either very poor stitching or holes in them. I assume they either have fake stuff or get given the poor quality / faulty items from the manufacturer"
"I shop from zalandos  frequently, ive recommended  it to family, and nobodys ever had a problem. Returns  and deliverys been brilliant. Ive never had an issue. The only thing sometimes is their description is not as detailed for some items. But tbh they have really good offers n prices."
"I bought a lot of things from them.When it goes well, it is ok (on-time, good packaging, priced reasonable etc)When it goes bad and you need to return something or use their customer service support, then they are a disaster. Waiting 15 days for refund or refuse to compensate for damaged article among other stories.So use them at your own risk."
Got many items from them great tracking on time delivery .
They are just blocking money but not delivering anything. I've order twice but didn't receive the goods nor money back!
"Waiting on a refund, been 14 days. Just keep getting told to fill a form out... Passed from pillar to post, customer service is shocking!!"
Avoid avoid avoid! Terrible customer service- i am on my 5th request for Hermes to pick up a return and they haven’t turned up again. Shocking services-zalando customer service do nothing and are completely useless.
"APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICEThis is the worst customer service experience I have ever had to go through despite my sending and receiving packages several times a week.  Four times zalando’s courier firm (Hermes) have failed to collect my return.  Twice they lied and said I wasn’t in.  Perhaps this is to be expected from Hermes but the worst part is that zalando have ignored all my emails complaining about the courier failing to turn up.  I have asked for a manager to contact me but they haven’t bothered to even acknowledge the trouble I am having.  I tried live chatting which was useless.  I finally managed to get through on the telephone this morning but they were of no help whatsoever.  I finally got an email from zalando, just now to say the courier is coming tonight.  No apology or explanation or an enquiry as to whether it would be convenient for me to stay in for a fifth night!  I am having to delay my plans for this evening to wait in again for Hermes.   This is actually very stressful and is the last night I wait in for them.  It is also the last time I ever order from zalando.  Their manager should be embarrassed but they can’t even be bothered to acknowledge the problem."
I’ve now amended my original review of this company as I’ve received a full refund. I checked on the location of my parcel via Hermes code on receipt they gave me. It showed that the products had got back to Zalando on 8/3. I then received an email from Zalando to advise they’d received my order back and a refund would follow. Which it did. Overall I think that Zalando delivered a good service and I would use again.
I returned to Zelando 4 items in ONE parcel and I received refund for one item only! They lost 3 other items I sent in the same parcel. Who is working there????? Now they ask me to fill some funny form with details i sent them already...it must be a joke! Very disappointed. Not even one star I would give!
This company is absolutely shocking been 18 days trying to get a refund still not sorted absolute joke sent forms and id as requested given no time frame when this will be solved would avoid at all costs
"I bought a pair of hiking shoes, they became defective after less than 2 months, reported and Zalando thought they could send me a £15 credit on a £60 pair of shoes. Then contact their online support and staff were so rude and ignorant. Never will deal with Zalando again - horrendous service and attitude"
"Ordered a hoodie, small size, I literally had it unpacked for 60 second to find out it is a wrong size, put it back in the original packing with original labels and eveything the way it was and returned. Now they are saying there are signs of usage?! They sent a picture in which I cant see any?! Do not want to refund me or provide a voucher or exchange it for a different size. Called them and texted them twice, but they do not acknowledge my comments, I always receive the same template response about the signs of usage. If you happen to overlook an email from them, then be careful, because after 14 days they will rip you off and keep both - the clothing as well as the money. The only hope for me right now is to have the original wrong size sent back to me, but I dont need it."
After reading bad reviews I was so worried because I had already placed an order my trainers took a little longer than the date I  expected but not much like an extra week this is a really good company just lack a good delivery service.I placed another order that never arrived but this was due to Hermes I contacted Zalando and received my refund the same dayI will use Zalando in the future
Not happy with Fila socks. The quality is very poor. It transfers colour to the carpet while wearing it.when I take the socks off there are additional material stuck to the bottom of my foot. I like a refund of my money but having difficulty contacting the customer services.
I had an issue with the delivery company and I've called Zalando Customer Service. I was talking with Micah McKay which is lovely and helpful lady. She get in touch with the delivery company  and sort out my issue. Thank you Micah McKay for your kindness.
Placed an order which was not delivered So contacted customer service I have never ever experienced such poor service they asked me to fill in a form which was printed done and sent 5 times along with I.D (where asks for this) and was told every time that either my signature wasn’t clear enough my address the format of the form was wrong etc this is clearly a strategy to withhold your payment I’m disgusted my bank has now been informed and a fraud dispute raised.
I have now received the full refund from Zalando. My previous reviews thought this comany was verging on the fraudulent but now they have issued my refund I think this was unfair. I think they just have awful administration and unable to join the dots to make life simple when an order doesn't go as planned.
Never had a problem with Zalando! Amazing products at some great prices.
Order arrived and everything satisfactory
"Just bought a pair of Asics Novablast 2 for 65 quid from Zalando. Almost seemed too good to be true, especially with so many bad reviews. Spoke to a friend who had ordered before with no issues so took the plunge. Trainers came a day early. What can I say... Great product, ridiculously good price and overall a superb service. Based on this purchase I'd definitely use Zalando again"
"If I could give this 0 stars I will. My order was to be delivered on the 16th Feb 2022 by Hermes. Today is the 19th and I have still have not received it. They keep telling me I should wait for them to hear from Hermes, I mean how how are you going to keep telling me that? They want me to wait till 22 Feb until they do something about this. I have been patiently waiting for Hermes to turn up at my door.  I try speaking to zalando about it, they keep cutting me off and telling me when ever they try to help I don’t cooperate. Staff at zalando have no emotions or the skills of dealing with customers. They are very rude"
"Unfortunately, Zalando sells fake items.I bought 2 identical Valentino bag (one for me and one for my sister), and they are different, different size, different sewing, the zipper is different as well.I went to check the reviews and I'm really shocked all the reviews have been submitted at the same day, how's that possible. More than 5 different people review it at the same day??I definitely want my money back!!!"
Item never arrived. After 10 days contacted them and they just refunded me the purchase amount.
"I have used this company multiple times and never had any issue with orders/returns/refunds however, my most recent order has been a nightmare. No return label included for Massimo Dutti item and I have now been waiting well over a month to get one. Multiple phone calls and online chats in which I am told to 'have more patience'. Today I asked to speak to a manager and was told none are available.  I am now going to put in an official complaint to see whether that gets me anywhere!......3 hours later and I have the label at last! I am amending my star rating from 1 to 3 as I have always found zalando very good until now."
Totally Rip off!!Bought a item for £79.99 and same item on Tommy Hilfiger official website is on for £33.00. Contacted customer services to price match but comes up with pathetic answers. Not recommended at all. Zero STARS
"I was keen on getting an item that was in high demand so I wanted to purchase it quickly. For some reason, there was a glitch on the website that made it impossible to go past the address stage of checkout.I had this item in my basket but they apparently don't offer a 'reserve' function, unlike every other clothing website I've used (for this very reason).Eventually, they got it fixed (after days) and the item was removed from my basket and it was out of stock.During this time, I reported the issue and kept raising the problem of it being out of stock soon but they offered no solution. It felt like I was talking to a brick wall... I've not had that experience with other clothing companies, and it was my first time using Zalango. No more..."
"DO NOT BUY FROM HERE. Absolutely rubbish customer service. I ordered a bag and they’ve sent me the completely wrong bag, different brand when I called customer service she refused to send me the correct item so unhelpful and rude. I’ve paid for a product and haven’t received my order.AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!"
"Returns are a mess for this company.  i returned a large portion of an order and received a refund for most of my returned items.  however i hadnt received a refund for some items that were also returned in the same package.  i thought its no big deal, just contact them and they will fix this.  everytime i contacted i was told i should either receive a return in 5-7 days and it is being handled by a higher department.  its been over a month and they have been ignoring me and still not refunded me the full amount i was meant to receive, this is over £300 they are still holding of mine.   The company does not seem to care and this essentially amounts to theft from a big company like them.  I would stay well away if you are looking to return anything at all, because Zalando will not hesitate to steal from you and there is essentially nothing you can do by contacting them.  They are a joke and waste of time in my honest opinion."
Ordered my items 2 weeks ago and still nothing. I have asked for a refund and keep being asked to wait a little longer.There’s were presents for friends.Was even given a wrong Hermes tracking number
Less than Primark quality at extortionate prices! Don't bother with this website. I can't figure out how they justify their prices - truly ridiculous.
"I love to use Zalando, you can find pretty much everything with good price and quality, brands we are already know at an excellent price.The customer service is the best I have seen so far! Fast response with knowledgeable people ready to sort out your issue - if they happen! Don’t think twice! Trustworthy!"
"I paid $110 for two pairs of shoes where the quality is absolutely disgraceful. Can't contact the Company at all.I suggest you don't buy and the 5 Star ratings you see, probably from the scammers themselves. So disappointed."
First time customer with Zalando. Never again.Order did not arrive. Received an email saying I had returned the item which I had not even received and I will be refunded. Refunded amount is incorrect and less than what I paid for the item!This company is not to be trusted and downright fraudulent.
"Issue: Massimo Dutti did not include a return label in the parcel. I do not have a printer.Resolution from Zalando: To post the return labelReality: They have gone back on their response to post me the return label to me and now they are telling me to print the return label repeatably.After 14 emails over 1 month - no resolution.This has caused me stress and time, I really regret buying from Zalando.Avoid Zalando, unless you are 100% sure you won't make a return and have a printer."
"Ordered 2 pair of shoes, arrived really quickly with standard delivery.  Arrangements to send back the pair that didn't fit very easy, sticker in box + a few clicks on website to arrange.  They will even come and collect it from your house!"
"The worst customer service ever on the face of this planet. You return an item, they fail to process it. They then put you through a stressful Hideous process of getting your money back. If you are lucky, you will get only anxiety fromThe process. Do not buy fromZalando please. Too much of a risk I’mAfraid."
"Order number18904001059545ordered  this item ,they never tried to deliver it , but said company makes three attempts, so called up the company on all three of the numbers I could find and they we are all voidI have not received my item and want a full refundThis company is a scam"
First time purchase from this company. Absolutely brilliant service from start to finish. Super quick delivery. Tommy Hilfiger trench coat packaged in a box. I will definitely be purchasing items again in the near future.
"I used to shop a lot on the Zalando website, well, I guess all good things must come to an end.I ordered a pair of shoes on 20th January, everything was fine, got a confirmation email, and two days later another email saying that my order is on its way. Then, on 26th January, I received another email saying that there's a delay with the delivery of my parcel, and they'll let me know when my parcel will be out for delivery. Already sus... Anyway, I waited patiently. Now here comes the interesting part... Yesterday, on 31st January, I received yet another email from Zalando, saying that they received my return. Umm... Which return exactly may I ask? I never even received this item!So I, of course, started my mission to find out what has happened. You would think that shouldn't be such a problem, right? Wrong. Trying to call them, number invalid. Trying to email them, bounces back. Trying to message them, no response. Shocking. It took a bit of investigation to find their chat function on the website, but I finally managed to get through to someone named Emille. After telling her what happened, she replies, and I quote: ""Upon checking you are being refund for the returned item. For this I suggest to please reorder the same item from your order.” Umm...Excuse you?! First of all, that’s not an explanation. Second of all, I would like to receive the pair of shoes I ordered, so I was expecting a bit more of an assistance than just a copy and paste template line. Third of all, even if I do wish to reorder (which, after this, definitely not going to happen in a million years…), how could I? These pair of shoes are not available online anymore! Then she goes on to say, “Hermes couldn’t deliver your parcel to your address and your parcel was stuck to Hermes that is why they just return it to Zalando”. After this, I didn’t know what to say other than “Is this a joke?”, because it sure sounds like one to me. What is causing them so much trouble in delivering a parcel? The numbers or the letters given? Or their GPS led them to Momma’s Little Bakery in Chicago? This is ridiculous.After all this, Emille just kindly repeated her template line saying “sorry”, and also added “it won’t happen again”, then abruptly ended the chat. Well, that’s right Emille, it won’t. Never again shopping on the Zalando website ever again.Thank you for the absolute horrible experience."
"I was just about to order a pair of Timberland boots for 100€, the last pair in my size.I left the page to check an email and when I returned to Zalando the price had gone up to 128, and a little note said that the price had changed.  I have never seen this happen on any other site. There is not enough in my account to finalise the transaction."
this company used to be great when I used them multiple times a few years ago but I've had a nightmare with 2 recent orders..didn't send one of my items and had to jump through hoops to get my refund reordered it and they've managed to send me out a total wrong size absolutely useless and customer service is a joke!!!
"Bought some boots on Zalando then came to check the reviews, was a bit shocked with all the poor feedback. However the boots arrived 2 days later with no problems at all, so it’s five stars from me."
Returned 4 items over a month ago - they acknowledged that they have received the items and the items are now back in the stock pool.They've asked me to fill in return statement and also send a picture of my driving license if I want a refund - despite not prompting me to do this previously and acknowledging they have received the items over a month ago.Would avoid as I have never heard of this return process previously.
I would rate Zalando as one of the best on line shopping sites. Brilliant service no hassle with delivery or returns and I’ve ordered a lot of items. Well done all the team at Zalonda my rating is💯
Two orders returned due to wrong size.2 weeks later I contact them to see where the refund was and find out my return is gone lost. Now need to fill up forms and send them back before they can refund money.I guess will take ages….Don’t waste time and money with this people
"Ordered for the first time, incorrect size was received. Sent item back, ordered again, received today - again wrong size received.Is it really that hard to send the correct size?A complete waste of my time. Would not recommend using a company who cannot send the correct size TWICE."
"Happy with the ordering of 2 items and the return process of 1 of them. I love my jacket and am pleased that my refund was really quickly processed.I know this is different to a lot of people here, but I am pleased with the overall experience."
I’ve had nothing but a positive experience in 5 years of ordering with Zalando - and have got some major bargains.Always delivers on time & great returns if needed. Brilliant !
"Useless service, waited and waited for them to then turn around and say the package went missing whilst on the way to me, they cannot replace it but refunded me, this was for my son's winter jacket for school so it's pretty annoying, I would have just bought it from the shop had I expected it not to arrive. Also Hermes is a disgusting delivery service, there is literally no one to speak to only robots smh"
"Very slow website to order from, no tracking, takes a few working days just to pack the order. Ordered from here because they were the only place that has in stock the size of shoe I wanted, else I wouldn’t ever order from here. Wouldn’t recommend unless you have too."
My wife has purchased a lot of items from this company and all went well until she had to return a coat. It is impossible to check if the refund is being made as there are no contact details available. Their customer service is non existing. I would strongly recommend that if you are also awaiting a refund that you take the matter up with whatever financial institution you used to process your payment. This type of behaviour should not be allowed. It is time to expose them.
"Ordered a number of items and they were delivered to me within a couple of days, quality is fantastic, would use again"
Takes ages and a lot of hassle to get your money back. Sick of waiting for refunds from them. Won’t shop here again. Can’t even email anyone. So bloody angry. Only way i could contact them was via a claim form for a defective item and now they’ve only partially refunded me. I will never never shop here again and you shouldn’t either
No wonder why they have got an overall avg. score of 2.5 here!I bought 3 products from them and had to return all because of the poor quality.
Ordered around Christmas time came within a week unfortunatly items not suitable sent them back via Hermes 2 days later who picked up on allocated day i chose and return was sent within the timescale stated on their website. Will be using again thankyou
I was a bit nervous about buying after reading the reviews. Ordered some Nike trainers in the sale. Placed order and arrived within a week.
Absolutely the most scamming company I’ve ever come across. I purchased a pair of shoes reduced to £118.99 from £199.00 on 26/12/21 . They gave me tracking number for Hermes. Tracking showed item arrived at local depot on the 17/01/22 with a message delayed. Than a further tracking information stating returned to sender ? I messaged Zalando at least 10 times without explanation why it was returned. Only an apology blaming Hermes! Why I asked many times they couldn’t explain. And just refunded my payment. Then I checked they had been al the time selling the same shoe for £ 199.00 . This company are unreliable and dishonest. Avoid them or possibly suffer the consequences like me
"I was a bit worried about ordering from Zalando considering the mixed reveiws but my experience has been positive. Very happy with Nike trainers at a great price. Had to return some joggers and order a smaller size. Refund received within good time. All in all, it worked out well for me."
"Worst customer support I have ever received, would not look into why my parcel had been delayed for well over a week with the delivery partner and then closed the web chat deliberately so that they didn’t have to reply.Avoid like the plague! Give your money to a business that actually cares for the customer experience."
"Bought shoes that look like beautiful soft leather and got a pair of plastic shoes in a plastic bag. No tags, so stamps or logos on shoes. Literally stuck plastic together with glue and put in a bag. So unprofessional, scam, ripped off, non existent company. Duped again. These online companies are a joke and nothing can be done to stop them."
Absolutely terrible service from Zalando. Sent my trainers back for refund and they still haven't refunded my money after nearly 7 weeks and don;t reply to correspondence. DO NOT USE THEM.
"horrendous customer service. I’ve got a missing order and still no refund whatsoever after almost two months now. They’ve requested me to fill in a form which I did, then decided to ask me for ID after two months. and there’s where all the giving me runaround starts. Contacted them via the live chat, after waiting for ages and explaining everything the lady decided to cut the chat. She requested me to email her my passport details in order to get a refund which is not pointed in their T&C. After I asked why are they requiring such personal information the lady decided to  just get away and ended the chat. After that I caller them and another phone useless customer service. Where I couldn’t even hear anything because she had dogs kids etc at the background after explaining and wasting my time again the lady seemed to have lack of knowledge and no clue. I was meant to get a call back which wasnt honoured at all. I think just another excuse to get away from it.  I’ve send multiple emails without any respond. I recommend you stay away from this brand. They refused to give me any information of how to make a complaint and talk to a manager."
"Didn’t want to give it one star but no other option. Parcel was supposed to be delivered on Friday 14th of January ordered over 2 weeks ago . Got an email on the Wednesday 12th to say delayed , tracking for Hermes didn’t move , emailed and told be patient . Then checked again tracking  still the same contacted them again told Hermes will deliver in 72 hours still not delivered and tracking not shifted. Do not use this company and Hermes as a courier service are a shambles.Cannot get a response from them either. I shall not or would not recommend this company to anyone I know."
"I cannot believe how bad their customer service is. I sent back an item on 27/12. They said they received and automatically refunded me. It's now 17/01 and I still have not had my £305. They finally today admitted they hadn't refunded me, I had to fill out a massive pain in the neck legal document, send a copy of my passport, proof of postage and their customer service is so rude. I emailed twice them weekly before this and was always told they'd refunded me and nothing more they can do. God knows when I'll get my money back. Stay away!!!"
"I'm giving 1 star as there's no option to give  no star. Waited for my order, was then informed I had returned it. The courier said  they hadn't  seen or heard about it. Complete waste of time. I've  sent them emails . No response."
"I ordered an item that was on Sale and I was really excited about. I got the dispatch note and saw that the tracking was ""Out for delivery"". Days were going by and it didn't update. It took me way too many rounds through their automated answers to be able to actually contact the customer service, only to find out that my parcel was lost.They did not offer a replacement, even though the item was still in stock (but now on full price). They just offered me a refund, told me to reorder the item and quit the chat. Then on the 2nd try I managed to squeeze out a discount code, but still would not match the original sales price. I still don't have a confirmation of my refund and the order still looks like it's in progress on my profile.Terrible service, would not recommend."
"I ordered a nike elemental backpack along with a hilfiger belt on the 2nd of January.I was told that it would be delivered from the 5th January-10th January,it ended up coming 2 days later than what they had said,they left updates but tracking wasn't available,they also said they suffered from extreme weather conditions when at most,it rained.I felt like you could easily get scammed.There are better websites available.Delivery isslow when it says on their website 3-6 days,"
"Disgraceful service.I ordered an item on Christmas Day whilst on holiday at a vacation home. Delivery was SEVERELY delayed - so I requested that delivery was cancelled, as I would no longer be at the vacation home to take delivery of the item. They assured me this would happen but it didnt - Hermes ""delivered"" the item and simply left it outside.No one lives at the address and no one could take the parcel in. Now I am trying to get my money back and Zalando are trying to drag me into a legal dispute because they do not understand what I am trying to communicate to them - I have spoken to around 7 different Zalando employees now and not a single one speaks fluent English - the customer service is DIABOLICAL and I am yet to receive my money or item - 3 weeks on.DISGRACEFUL - AVOID"
"After reading the recent reviews it seems im not the only one who have difficult times to deal with Zalando. I was asking a return label 11 days ago (also contacted them via chat) to return 2 hoodies that came with no return label and i've got nothing so far meanwhile there website saids it takes 24-48 hours to get one. This is unacceptable, i can't even log into my account as their website is down now. As soon as i can i will contact them one more time but this timr waiting only like a day before will contact to my bank to ask a chargeback. Sad because it was an excellent website before and this was my last visit for sure, i do not recommend to anyone to shop with them."
"Absolutely terrible service from Zalando!Waited 9 days for my order to arrive. The parcel was sent via Hermes! The worst courier service in the world. I was charged for postage where every other retailer posts (the shoes I ordered) for free!The item arrived in a very damaged paper parcel. It was not double boxed! The box for my shoes was also heavily damaged! Honestly, I was surprised to see the inner paper wrapping of the shoes was also damaged as if someone was trying to see what was inside. Hermes are nothing but a bunch of thieves! I’m not the only one who has had this issue.Please read all the other negative feedback on this company from so many other customers! The shoes were purchased as a gift. Imagine how terrible it would look to give someone damaged goods as a gift?Zalando customer service is nonexistent. You need to open a claim to discuss damaged postage/goods which will take another 2/3 days. This is unacceptable.My advice: if you see a retailer using Hermes as their courier. Please think twice about completing your purchase and go elsewhere.Avoid this company!!"
"I wasn’t sure if the shoes I’d ordered were legit but they were!! I’d ordered white Air Force 1s, They came in about 3 days in the original Nike box. 10/10 service would shop here again"
"My order was sent over 2 parcels via 2 different courier companies. neither arrived, one shows it left outside but Zalando considers this secure.I have been asked to complete the claim form  (twice) for each parcel. Now they are asking me to complete it a third time.  I've asked for a call back on many occasions from a manager this never happens and now there telephone number doesn't work.Will not use again, this is not the first time and doubt the last. It shows they do not care as they hardly respond to the feedback left on here."
"Shocking service received, no goods and no refund. Absolute shambles!"
"Where is my order???? This is the second time this happens. I get a message saying order is delayed and nothing else. I called Hermes and first was impossible to speak to someone and I got absolutely no update on the delivery. Then I tried all possible ways to contact Zalando to hear that email addresses are no longer in use, website chat doesn't exist, and absolutely no telephone numbers work!!! I urgently demand a response!!!"
I placed my order on 26 th December n still waiting for delivery. Try to send them email but got a message saying message blocked . Try to ring the customer care service but no response. Not happy with the service.
Excellent. Lovely Dr Martens shoes arrived within 2 days. No complaints here
Returned two items back to zalando for a refund over 2 weeks ago still no confirmation to say they received my items or how long my refund will beTwo weeks and still waiting AVOID THIS COMPANY!! I will take this to PayPal resolution centre and let them sort this out! NEVER WILL I ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!
Two weeks after ordering I still have not received my order because this company uses the utterly incompetent delivery service that is Hermes. Suggest you renegotiate your delivery contract with a reputable delivery company as despite the additional cost your customers will actually receive their orders.
"Ordered a sweatshirt which was delivered within 2 days direct from Adidas so no complaints here, great service. A returns label was included but not needed."
"Awful company, never shop here. Terrible customer service plus they use Hermes which is the worst courier in Britain."
"Ordered Nike trainers freestyle, arrived on time, box was blank and although they were what I wanted they broke within two days!! they look fake and do not look well made. i requested a refund, and to return them. they issued a partial refund of £16 even though the trainers were like 50 quid!! no contact number no email address. i have opened an issue with Paypal. they advised they would collect yesterday and have not arrived to take back.PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY - unless you are happy with this risk!! i have now reordered the trainers from Nike direct arrived today and they are a complete level of quality!! so my assumption is that they are selling FAKE items!!"
"Terrible delivery, took over 2 weeks to receive one item and still awaiting one that was ordered before Christmas, all I get told is hold on. Tried to return the first item, says delivered but no refund. Will be contacting bank for money back as customer care is poor"
"Really bad returns, sent 3 items back in the same box, they’ve only credited 2 items, refusing to look into this, making me fill out forms, yet they won’t question why their staff never processed the 3rd item. Looks like staff stealing returns or completely incompetent, but still waiting for a large refund.Customer service is non existent"
"Placed an order to receive the wrong item. Then returned the item and re-ordered to then receive the same wrong item AGAIN.Customer services told me to return the item and re-order again, (also will have to pay £3 delivery for a 3rd time) is this some kind of joke?Terrible service"
"Love the Dr Martens I bought from Zalando at around £30 cheaper than they were available anywhere else. Delivery was free and arrived quickly and on time. It seems a lot of the negative reviews have been to do with delivery or returns, unfortunately they use Hermes and the reviews suffer because of that, based on my experience though I'd definitely recommend Zalando and Hermes were spot on on this occasion"
"Returned my order 29 Nov. They claim to have received it 10 Dec. Despite countless phone calls, live chats and emails I am still waiting for my refund today (31 days after they claim to have received my returned order)Currently filing a chargeback with my payment card provider and escalating this breach of consumer law (by law, retailer must provide refund within 14 days of receiving returned goods)"
Terrible service. I never received my order. After claiming for a replacement they told me they would only refund my money so I can buy it again at a higher price. Do not buy Zalando!
"0800 number they advertise is a mental health helpline! Their 020 number no longer works. So if you are looking to order goods in good faith, sail past the delivery date, no updated information, no goods being delivered, just find yourself watching a tracker that hasn't updated since the day after the items were ordered - then use this company! If you want to actually receive goods and not give up your time trying to locate if they are ever going to arrive - then don't use this company! Am reporting them today to trading standards and if my goods don't arrive soon I'll be doing a paypal claim for my funds back! What an utter disgrace! Absolute joke! Birthday they were purchased for has been and gone! Never again"
"Ordered an item in November which turned out to have the wrong product code and description on the website, so the images displayed were of the item I wanted, but the title and description were all wrong. I was confused when I received the item which looked nothing like that in the images. I did a reverse image search and found that the Merrell Bravada Polar was being mis-sold as the Merrell Ontario Tall Polar. Two completely different products. I also bought it in the Black Friday sale so it was discounted at the time, however when I was instructed to re-order the item again, believing it was just a warehouse error rather than the website error it was, I was charged extra for the replacement and promised a ‘price match refund at a later date’. When I explained my query to customer service, I got a load of inconclusive, cryptic jargon and excuses as to why this had happened. I ended up cancelling both orders and ordering elsewhere for much cheaper. I am still waiting on a refund and haven’t been able to return the incorrect items as apparently my address ‘doesn’t exist’?!! How is it that I can receive the order just fine but when it comes to trying to return it, it is almost impossible? It is now January and I still have no resolution to this issue…"
"Really poor. Ordered some items over 2 weeks ago, still not received and customer service aren’t telling me anything about where it is or how long it will be. They have of course taken the money from my bank account. Absolute rubbish customer service."
I’ve been ordering off zalando for years now. I only stumbled across this page when I was checking out a different retailer and was really shocked to see such a low rating for zalando. Ive always found their returns are quicker than asos and I’ve managed to source quite a few Norwegian and Swedish brands at a much cheaper price and minus the brexit tax issues (I am based in Uk). Delivery has always been quick and Hermes is great. honestly cannot fault them!
"I like zalando but, they never post my bad reviews and that makes me very disappointed."
Such a  horrible company. Sent back item in November. In January still no refund. Avoid. Nobody in zalando happy to help. You chatting with assistant and they only do empty promises. Avoid!!!!
Ordered some Nike react visions they took payment a week later I decided to enquire about my order and they tell me something went wrong and they couldn’t send them they said I’d I want another pair I can purchase them again. What a waste of time!!
Wow excellent first time ordered from this site very fast delivery will defo order again
"Seen some of the other reviews on here but can honestly say experience has been very good. Purchased 3 separate items from different affiliates via Zalando and all arrived on time, Correct sizes and well packaged!"
"Terrible companyBought bag as Xmas gift for someone early December, arrived without shoulder strap .Contacted company, they said will send strap . Gave present to someone who lives miles away and told them strap will fallow . Was out of country during Xmas . Come back now they say send bag back for them to check and buy new one . Bag out of stock . No strap . Have to travel so far to ask person back for bag to return it . No present for them . Was told no solution that is their policy . No compensation offered .Sending incomplete order and then telling to send back and fill in papers without considering customer who paid large amount for bag and purpose of purchasing.Customer services twice discounted call third time Nial was just not want to listen or offer any solution only to take Xmas present away from person and send back and go on mailing list to wait when bag in stock and give refund .Absolute joke .Won’t be ever buying anything from here .And looking only now how bad reviews they have …. No surprise."
"No problems at all, ordered some shoes at a great price and they arrived as described before the delivery date. I think most of the bad reviews are from people returning items so just make sure of your size before you order. Will use again."
"Ordered 3 different items on 3 different occasions which some how all got ""lost"" in transit. One of which was a Christmas present which I was promised would turn up by 23rd December at the latest...and it didn't."
"Liars / dishonest -  Have proof.I ordered at Carlo Culucci jumper in the sale and unfortunately it didn’t fit, by the time it arrived the size I needed was out of stock and it also went up in price, so I went to zalandos on line chat straight away and asked if I can get the same price I paid for the item originally when it is back in stock in the size that fits, the guys chat name name was barlaan and he said “no worries at all once it’s back in stock pay for the item and once the order has been done we will refund the difference” so I can get it at the original sale price as agreed before I ordered it the second time, since ordering it they will not uphold what there service staff member barlaan said they will do and used excuses like time periods etc that was never mentioned by barlaan, the chat was saved and I also had screen shots of this conversation but they still would not honor it ( bear in mine this is all within a month ) the second jumper does not fit still so I have had to send that back for a full refund anyways ( large is more like a medium, XL is like a large etc )So because of all this I will never use zalando again and will 100 percent read reviews first as this company have too many poor reviews so I could of saved myself this hassle, in a way it’s ok cos I had many items in the basket ready for January sales but now I purchased them else where and even got some items cheaper than zalandos so called deals.Shop else where, Zalandos do have good deals if you catch them at the right time as the prices are up and down like a yo yo but the small amount you save is worth spending ( we are only taking a couple £ at a time ) for the better service else where and as mentioned it will 100% cheaper else where if you look I like I did…I only looked cos of zolandos poor customer service regards the jumper so thank you as you have saved me money and hassle shopping with you again."
"No exchanges and a two week refund process? Clowns. Plus, they use Hermes as a courier. I wonder if I'll get my money back?Better off in John Lewis."
A company I have never heard of is now on the bank account. What?
"Terrible dishonest company. Worst customer service i've ever experienced. I purchased a pair of Candice Cooper boots for £194.99 they arrived just fine but I decided not to keep them and returned them a couple of days later. I used their pre-paid returns system through Hermes. I received notification that my return was in their system and i'd be refunded within 14 days.After 14 days there was no refund so I contacted customer services who asked me to provide a photo of the Hermes ticket I was issued when the returned was processed. I did this, then after a bit of back and forth with Customer Services not being able to find my return. They said that the box had arrived at the warehouse empty!! and I had to include the items if I wanted a refund. I was shocked as I absolutely included  the boots! They were either lying or this was an issue that had taken place within their return system. I asked them to investigate the matter internally but they point blank refused and said it wasn't possible for an item to be removed from the box. I was a victim of these going missing but they were so unhelpful and accusatory to me that I reported it to the UK police. They had me doubting the Hermes driver but now reading the reviews on here this seems a regular occurrence for this company not to refund and I no longer believe it to be a Hermes issue but rather an internal issue. Either they are completely incompetent or fraudulent but currently they have stolen £194.99 of my money and won't communicate with me through customer services. Shocking, shocking state of affairs that I had to deal with with the police and paypal in the days before Christmas which proved a total drag. I feel like i've been robbed of £194.99. Avoid like the plague! 1 star is too many wish there was a zero option. They need to not be trading if they trade in this corrupt manner."
Awful customer service. They sent me out the wrong size and they wouldn’t replace it. They said I had to place another order but the item had gone up from £40 to £75. Even though it was their mistake they refused to help. I argued with them for 15 mins they eventually said the would make an exception for me and if i placed another order they will refund the difference but I don’t trust them after they refused to write their wrong in the first place.
Disgusting customer service! Having to explain yourself to 20 different people and getting different responses! This is outrageous! Especially when your paying high end prices for designer clothes!!
Very disappointed in Zalando. I am not able to use PayPal anymore. And none of my orders goes through after I confirm the payment through my bank. On a parcel I actually received the return sticker is missing. :/ And Zalando makes it extremely difficult to contact customer service.
Sent a damaged item in the wrong size. Terrible customer service team. Hard to understand and miscommunication. Told me to email an invalid email address. Do not use!
got my order today one of the items i brought was meant be be size 3 years which was stated on invoice and packaging but the jumper was tiny checked label on item it was for baby 12 to 18 months spoken to customer service using the chat as no contact number waste of time and money i will never use this website again customer service is rubbish and item was missed labelled and sent out of i guess total service was rubbish to wish i had read the reviews before i purchased never again void like the plague.even trying to return on website cant get it to show a date for collection crap website terrible experience.
My experience was great. Ordered some Nike trainers on Monday and they arrived on Thursday. No issues - would use again anytime.
"I return a Levis shoe order. Schedule a pick-up time with Hermes for 28th of December and this not happen, deliverymen, not show up with any notice for the whole day, I understand that is Christmas time so  I been waiting the following whole day 29 and nothing happens. I spoke to your customer service over the phone and the lady did not offer me anything for that and said that she can reschedule the delivery for tomorrow but she can't promise the collection will happen just because is Christmas time. I think this way of treatment is affecting the good PR of Zalando in overall."
"Received faulty item, returned it using their label. Receipt of return confirmed - no refund. Contacted them, still no refund. Customer service extremely poor. Avoid at all costs if there is any chance of return."
I made an order and the package never arrived. The service team was extremely unhelpful.
"I’m really upset with them! I use to buy each week for at least £200 I stopped but returned on a Boxing Day. I place the order for £105 and reason why I returned is because they gave me a voucher 15% I added this voucher on the end but it doesn’t work! Take took whole money without didactic 15%! Is not about money is about principal! They lie me! I went on live chat! Spoken with 3 different advisers all them said different things so very unprofessional! Well one thing they said the same on the end! “ sorry mam” I don’t want your sorry I just want what you promised! So this is my first step review here, then every possible like website etc. I will aware a lots of people and of course will cancel my order and never buy again!"
Tracking for order never worked. Absolutely no updates. Tried to get info but Zalando ‘customer service’ was absolutely atrocious. Apparently my package was delivered to a neighbour but no details given. They kept sending me tracking for a previous order of mine. I still have not received tracking for the missing order. Cowboy set up. Avoid at all costs!
"I will never use Zalando ever again. Absolute shambles of a company. Sending completely different items to those advertised, late orders, crap communication, they send you review request emails for products you haven’t received yet and the best of all, if you do bother to write them a deserved crap review they don’t put it on their website 🤣🤣🤣"
Whilst browsing the website I noticed a number of suspicious looking items. I would be incredibly surprised if a cardigan with the label Monkl (when the brand name is Monki) turns out to be genuine. It’s making me concerned about an item I have already ordered. Has anyone else received an item that is fake?
Ordered Nike trainers on Sunday 19th December and they came Wednesday 22nd. Fast delivery and great service
"Ordered a pair of trainers at a huge discount and they arrived Christmas eve! Prefect fit, very happy with them indeed!"
"Couldn’t find the trainers i wanted in my size anywhere until i came across this wee gem of a website, not only did i get the trainers i wanted i also got 10% off. Safe to say this site is now in my bookmarks and would highly recommend."
"I always order Christmas gifts at Zalando, great prices, good quality and always deliver fast.  I ordered on Tuesday and received it today Friday, in time for Christmas. Thank you!"
Bought a coat £529. 99.  Delivered on 6th November. Sent it back same day as it was too big using the return label in the box and had it scanned at my local drop off Tesco collect +.  Been trying ever since to get the hold of someone in this company as no refund has been given to date. Only genetic responses each time I email. Impossible to get a human on the phone or email.  Avoid this company at all costs.  I'm contacting my bank now as I've had enough. Horrendous experience from this company.
"Ordered a gilet before I’d read reviews and then feared the worst! Item ordered was received within 3 days in time for Xmas, well packaged and exactly as I expected so no complains from me, seems like others have had problems with the delivery company more than Zalando"
"Very efficient company. Good prices, fast delivery, easy returns, quick refunds."
All I can say is that by selecting Hermes as their courier Zalando is exposing itself to huge reputational damage. Ditch Hermes immediately!Don't be seduced by free delivery if the chances of receiving your goods are slim.
Shoes never turned up! Contacted on chat and they said they've lost them! Wt..((?!)) Apparently a refund will appear in 5 days and its just a stupid company with zero customer service and zero logistics in place . I doubt they even had the shoes I bought and I wasn't offered any compensation for my hassle. I'm hoping this will help steer anyone considering purchasing from them away from zalando and avoid like the plague..save your  time and money these people are complete incompetents.
"Useless customer service, ordered a pair of gloves which ripped on the third day (wasn’t even wearing them when they ripped) and customer service doesn’t do anything."
It’s taken me a day or 2 to calm down enough to write this and I’m basing this review on how Zalando responded and not the fact Hermes delivered my parcel to a completely different house (the pic was not my front door) as always Hermes denied it even tho I sent pics of my doorI must say Zalando replied to every email and put up with my annoyance on chat. After filling out a form I was refunded.I can’t fault them and I would buy from them again IF they stopped using Hermes.
Ordered two pairs of Dickies trousers for my son for Christmas on 5 December.  Order sent out for delivery by Hermes who allegedly were 'unable to deliver' and would be attempting again.  On 19 December I was asked for a review by Zalando so I chased the missing parcel again and was informed that the parcel had now been lost by Hermes.  Zalando are unable to send out a replacement order and will be refunding me.  Neither Zalando or Hermes got in touch with me about the lost parcel - I had to do all the chasing.  Poor.
I ordered a present from Zalando and was given a delivery date between the 14 and 17 of December. The order never arrived and only when I contacted them I was made aware that my order is not coming at all. Really bad experience and I won't be shopping from them again.
"I don’t usually leave a review but thought I would for this one as there are a lot of bad ratings saying people never receive their order. I was a bit worried as I read the reviews for Zalando after I had already paid and ordered, however I received my parcel on time , correct items. Reason for 1 less star is because the box it came in was damaged but obviously it’s only packaging so wasn’t bothered"
"They are impossible to get hold of if you have a problem with your order! I tried to contact them through Twitter (as they have no contact details on their website at all) and they kept sending me links to their website and told me to contact them through there, even though when I clicked on the link it said on their website ‘unfortunately we are unable to offer any contact details at this time’ they are without a doubt the worse customer service I have ever come across!! They purposely make it hard for you to contact them so they don’t have to give you a refund!"
"An actual half eaten, mouldy slice of lemon fell out of the jacket I ordered when I tried it on. Disgusting and bloody weird"
"This is the worst company I have ever used. They have not delivered the item, refuse to refund and will not terminate the agreement even within the 14 day period as per the law and their terms and conditions. Please do not use this company!!!"
"Prompt to take your money.But that’s about it. Even 1 star is too much.Been trying to return the parcel for 2 weeks, their courier never showed up and lied about this. Fine. Impossible to go through someone from zalando. Had to go on twitter to find the right details… i wasted 4 days waiting for this return and even 2h more trying to return the parcel myself, but the shop wouldn’t take it back as it was too big!!I asked twice for a formal complaint to be registered - but systematically told to « rest assured we will raise this feedback ». I am way beyond feedback, I want to raise a formal complaint, I want my money back and to be compensated for my time and the enormous stress I endured because of this dishonest company."
"Ordered some ankle boots and received a ceramic fish. I'm not being metaphorical here, i actually received a ceramic fish. it's called an ""extra large gluggle jug"". I spent 60 pounds on boots and got this instead. I checked on their website, they don't even sell things like this."
"So pissed about this ... I ordered a black Tommy Hilfiger long gilet jacket and they took the cash... that’s grand ... then refunded me a week before Christmas saying the item is no longer in stock ? ..Only for me to go back on there website and check that it’s still in stock ,the exact same sizes still there with all the other sizes out of stock  ..!so it’s not like they got a fresh batch because I was looking at it constantly waiting for my new to be jacket to come ,as I was admiring it on there website ,but no ..I got a refund ,no jacket for me for Christmas !and a scabby 10% off my next order ...Like keep your 10%..and now the jacket is gone up in price the last few they had (sizes M and L ) on special back to 350€ But it’s really not actually there because it’s sold out .. if the item is sold out take it off the site !"
Ordered a Valentino man bag before reading any reviews. Read some after purchasing stupidly so was pretty nervous and sceptical but it came quick and was well packaged. No complaints from me.Still worried to order again due to all the bad reviews…
Bad service. Never recived my order.Blaming it on the delivery company even if they never got the package.
Carnt belive all these bad reviews am Mande up with the service orderd Nike top for my son for Xmas Got free next day delivery then they sent me £10 off so got a pair of Nike trainers for 70 Next day delivery and everywer else there £95 So thanks so much Zalando deffo will be putting more orders in with youse 1st time used and I carnt fault them 5stars for me 👌👌👌👌
"I will not use this company again . I ordered a handbag, on the 26th November , i watched the tracking. I then received a refund on 2nd of December saying  i no longer wanted the item. After sending emails saying i did want this, they sent one saying 3 attempts had been made to deliver. No attempts, or cards, had been put through my door. Tracking had said still  in process. I tried more emails ,only to come back no one available to accept my email. Just tell the truth. an old gentleman was upset by this as i had got it for him to give to his wife for Christmas. Dont ignore peoples emails Zalando this was your problem not mine."
"This company does not deserve a star rating. Absolute rubbish. The customer service agents haven’t got a clue.  Seriously I urge people not to use this company. I’ve been waiting 3 weeks for a parcel as a Christmas present and they are trying to blame me for it not been delivered. It’s been held with ups. In other words they’ve lost it and everyone I ring, webchat or email I’m getting the same old story. I’ve got to wait another 5 days. I only wished I had read some of the reviews first.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY."
"Extremely poor serviceChristmas presents ordered online, waited for delivery but nothing.No communication or delivery.I had to chase these guys and only then I was told nothing is going to be delivered, only a few days before Christmas."
"My daughter ordered shoes in early November. They have never arrived. She has repeatedly tried to contact Zalando, even taking to Twitter to get their attention which also failed. They have taken her money and left her with nothing. Not trustworthy.Update: Following yet another complaint submitted to Zalando, they responded and refunded my daughter."
"Found an item that was sold out on other sites. Glad i didn’t read the reviews here before, as I probably wouldn’t have ordered. Free delivery and arrived in 3 days - great little website."
Zelando advertise products that are out of stock whilst same time charging you for the product that they don’t have in stock. Then after several chase up emails without any apology and communication refund your money.
I went to collect my parcels from the pick up point. The code wouldn't scan so even though they were on the counter I couldn't take them. I rang the Zalando helpline but it is no longer in use. I sent an email to Zalando but it said emails are no longer attended and I should check the FAQs. None of the FAQs related to my problem so I connected to a digital assistant who couldn't do anything. I've paid £150 and can't collect my items or speak to anyone about them. I'm going to have to contact Citizen's Advice. Be careful with Zalando.
"Wouldn’t even give 1*I ordered an item, they sent me a completely different item, explained everything on Live Chat, was told to return item for a refund (bare in mind I still wanted original item so was waiting on the refund to re-order) also sent me a discount code out of a gesture of goodwill.Returned said item, waited for an update and this is where the problems started. 4 days after the tracking on THEIR website stated they had it scanned back at their warehouse, I go on chat and I am lied to by John, who first tried to tell me they don’t have the parcel and I am to get an update from Hermes once they’ll investigated. No, firstly, Hermes tracking was all up to date and shows that the last scan is the item being returned back to merchant. Eventually John confirmed the parcel was back at warehouse to then only go back on what he had said and now claiming parcel is ‘almost’ at warehouse…. What is almost? Just around the corner, on the lorry? Does he have lice tracking of the lorry? Ridiculous. I spent 2 hours on chat with John getting fed lies, so I decided to end chat, go on chat again and ask the same question and was told by a day different advisor that yes, they did have this back at their warehouse FOUR days ago. When I asked how I make a complaint, I simply got told “you can’t make a complaint at the moment”I escalated this whole thing and then got a response via email apologising for the mix up bla bla bla and that “out of a gesture of goodwill” they will refund me if I fill in their legal internal document. FIRSTLY, it is NOT a gesture of goodwill, you’re legally obliged to refund me for sending an incorrect item and for not rectifying the issue. SECONDLY, these ‘internal legal documents’ hold no legal baring WHAT SO EVER. And you are not obliged to sign it and they can no refuse your refund if you don’t sign it. Anyway, I signed it as I thought it would speed up my refund process… no, 2 days later I got told they’re refusing my refund as the bag I ordered had a scan at their warehouse pre-delivery… a warehouse scan does not mean the bag I ordered has been packed and posted to me. I informed them I would be sending a Letter Before Action and would be taking them to small claims court and I would receive the money I am entitled to that way. Low and behold I wake up to the £400 in my account the next morning.When I dared to question as to why NOW they’ve magically changed their mind again, they try to tell me the refund had been put through in error??? And that they would recoup it again from my account. Are they having a laugh? Once again, when I explained the legal side of it stating it is against the law for them to do ANY unauthorised transaction to take money from my account, and that I would also now be taking this information to court, because their behaviour is not in line with the the Consumer Rights Act, they’ve gone quiet again.AVOID using them, they have messed up every part of this experience right for them moment they sent me the incorrect item all the way through the lies and misleading information I was told via live chat and even the emails I had received from ‘higher up’ claiming my refund would be “out of a gesture of goodwill” is bloody INSULTING, to then REFUSING the refund, to then GIVING me the refund and to finally say they’re going to take back the refund. On your bike, ZalandoZalando, you seriously need to to retrain your customer service team, your warehouse team and your team responding on behalf of your Management, the advisor known as Hanga Kane has not only made a mockery out of me, but also out of you, making your company look a laughing stock with all the conflicting information I have been provided with."
Provided a refundI hope I haven’t checkedBut could have kept the sale  if they had honoured Black Friday sale price placed on item 24 hours later if I had reordered abd returned original item could have got itThey did not have the good grace to honourThey have very poor online feedback not sure this a sign of a great business
"Used to be good. For god’s sake don’t trust them now, you’ll regret it. I used Zalando for years with no issues but something has changed and they now claim items are used when you try to return them, refuse to refund you and completely ignore emails. They’ve just cut off their phone lines too so there’s no way of calling them either. It almost feels like the business is about to go under or something"
Bought a pair of soft leather shoes to wear to a funeral. Hermes dropped the box outside my door and left. I do not believe they left the parcel as we have had many instances here were they take the picture then take the parcel with them. I have a note ony Zalando account stating do not leave parcels at front door. This was my first purchase and I spoke to 3 customer service agents not a single 1 acknowledged the distress I was in over not only losing someone I carry about but for this issue with the package. I offered to buy another pair and pay for express delivery as I couldn't get the shoe anywhere else. They were unwilling to accommodate any aspect of this. Both Zalando and Hermes do not care about their customers. Buy here with extreme caution.*UPDATE* Zalando contacted me to investigate the missing shoes. It was very obvious that Hermes messed up because they said they delivered to my porch and I don't have one. Zalando gave me a full refund. They have also reported this to the police and they are investigating. Which I am pleased about Hermes need to do better as a company. I could not find the boots anywhere else so I was able to purchase the shoes for collection this time. So I have adjusted my rating. I am deducting stars because again I didn't believe that the customer services responded with empathy however they were efficient and that counts for everything.
An e-commerce provider that doesn’t hold themselves to high standards when it comes to customer service. Failed deliveries by Hermes mean that items are lost and cannot be replaced until a non customer centric process has been followed. Another business with ‘computer says no’ process warriors in the customer care team. Completely obtuse service and customer care responses. App deleted. Will not shop with Zalando again
"Absolutely brilliant, was abit hesitant at first from previous reviews but couldn't fault this website at all.. delivery came fast and products were spot on. Would deffoo order from here again."
"I'm actually impressed with the company. First time using them, competitive price. Trainers came in good condition and right size. After reading the reviews I was nervous as I'd already placed the order and had read many people not receiving their goods. The item was delivered very quickly after placing the order. Will use again."
"I decided to update my wardrobe and do it with Zalando.I ordered a lot of items with a total cost total: 3924.01 £.Some items I liked, others I decided to return.The total cost of the things I decided to keep: 1644.38 £I sent items back in 5 parcels. But for some reason Zalando has not refunded all of them.Zalando refunded 1237.55 out of 2279.63. I asked customer service about this.This is their reply:>> Unfortunately, we have received information that we are not able to refund the order. I'm sorry.>> Have a great week!So, Zalando literally stole 2279.63 - 1237.55 = 1042.08 £ and refused to provide any comments about it.They also refused to send items back which they don't want to refund."
"Item was due a week ago, still hasn’t shown up and no updates to the tracking in 10 days. Emailed Zalando 4 days ago and still no response on where it is."
"Bought 2 items. Only one arrived. Was asked to complete a form sent to me by Email. Sent form back and now being asked for ID, driving licence or passport. Ridiculous. Have now asked for refund, which I don't expect to get back. Luckily not a lot of money spent. Very poor after sales. UPDATE. One day later I have now received the refund. Now given 3 stars."
"The goods are great, but they stupidly insist on using the worst courier in the world, Hermes not once have I had a delivery on time, waiting and changing my time 3 times in one day to then tell me it won't be arriving until the next day now and time cannot be confirmed, Until this changes, when I receive my item I will never purchase from them again"
"Worst Customer ServiceSent wrong size, haven't responded to email for over a week, finally found a phone number, definitely be dealt with today - was it? 2 days later still nothing. Brilliant when it's a Christmas present ordered in November."
"Awful returning experience.I ordered 20 pairs of shoes to try on and chose to keep 2. They were delivered by Hermes in a van. Upon requesting a return it all seemed fine.The Hermes courier showed up in his car and refused to take the parcel as it was too big.I decided to then go to a Parcel Shop to drop it off but they told me it was too big too and to arrange a collection. The lady there told me to ensure Zalando booked a van to pick up the package instead due to size.So I called Zalando and explained this, the lady on the phone seemed to just want to book in another normal collection and I told her it needs special notice for hermes and she then just told me she would escalate it and I would hear back the same day.Never did hear back so called and explained all over again. This time the guy I spoke to said he would note down it was large and escalate it. This time it was booked to collect. But... the same courier turned up and refused it again. So they did not book the correct Hermes service again.Third call, the lady seemed to understand the issue and said she would email me after escalating it. Her email just asked if I wanted to rebook the collection. But ignored all my comments.I emailed back asking to confirm it would be booked correctly with Hermes and then an hour later simply got given the identical email reply again.They even say to call to sort larger collections but their staff don't seem to have a clue how to arrange one and keep palming me off with a courier who keeps refusing it.This is all in the same box Zalando shipped it in so this should be fine to return.Now stuck in a loop with Zalando refusing to listen and sort it, with over £1000 of products I apparently am never going to be able to return.Hassle free, free returns they say... but if you buy a large order they just don't seem to want to help.No idea what to do now."
Worst company I have ever dealt with .. 11 emails and still no further forward regarding an order that was cancelled then sent and refusal to pick up and no refund … avoid at all costs
"I wouldn’t even give this company one star !!I ordered over £300 worth of under armour on Friday 26th ( Black Friday) I was told my parcel will be delivered between 3rd-6th December - absolutely fine! I then received an email on Wednesday 1st to let me know my item has been shipped, 10 days later still no parcel. I have been tracking the parcel up until last night, it is now showing “ return to sender” and that is was being held at my local pickup point. I quickly drove to the pickup point and the shop owner said it has not been delivered to the shop. So, I emailed Zolanda and they have had the cheek to tell me they attempted to deliver my parcel 2 days after my order was made, 2 days on the busiest weekend of the year - I don’t think so ! Also, remember I received an email on the 1st saying it has only just been shipped so how have they try to deliver a parcel at 10am 48 hours after the delivery was made on a weekend if the order had not even left the depot !My parcel has now been sent back as they said I “refused the delivery “ and I will have to wait 14 days until my parcel reaches the depot to start the refund process !!!DO NOT EVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY !!!"
"Ordered under armour item for a Christmas present. Delivery due on the 4th December. Still nothing has arrived today (10th December) spoke with an agent on the live chat and was told that due to them putting an incorrect address on the label the parcel has been returned to them. I’ve asked for this to be reshipped straight away however, computer says no and now I’ve got to sit and wait 10 working days for a refund to then order the items again! No thanks I’ll order items elsewhere"
"Awful!!! complete con.Placed order on Black Friday, ordered & items only two sent and they are refusing to re send missing items...offered refund but the price is three times the sale price.I have contacted BBC watch dog... advise anyone else in same situation to do the same... let help build a case against these crooks"
"Love them!! Big choice of clothes,boots!!! Good price and even when sale you can by with -50-70% discount!!! If I don't like item never was problem to return with free prepaid label. Always received money back without any problems. Thank you!"
"Worst service I’ve ever received, ordered some gifts needed for this Friday in November, I’ve been expecting them since 29th, I’ve spoke to Hermes and Zalando Hermes told me to speak to zalando to arrange a replacement or refund and zalando have told me I have to keep waiting basically for a parcel I’m never going to get. Zalando have told me everyday it’s due for delivery today if it doesn’t arrive we will look into it, 7 days later they still haven’t bothered to look into it. Save your time and money"
Absolute garbage company. Ordered 2 items 29 Nov 21. Fast forward no responses from customer services so I contacted paypal to get involved as the order had not arrived or been dispatched after 10 days. Now I get a dispatched email to say 2 to 5 days for delivery. Could be well over 2 weeks to arrive. They clearly dont care about their customers. I wont order again.
"First time shopping with this company. Wish i'd read the reviews here first.Two different shipments, both 'lost' by Hermes although I'd been receiving orders and I'd even had a collection from Hermes. Something very wrong with this company, spend your money elsewhere."
Awful. My order was never dispatched. No communication. I had to chase them up. Still couldn’t guarantee me a delivery date only that they were “ringing the warehouse” and that they were “too busy with orders”. I feel so sorry for you being too busy with so many orders that you cannot even dispatch a pair of training trainers in 9 days! Awful company. Awful customer service. DO NOT USE ZALANDO. Order elsewhere
"No refund yet, signed for a week ago and still not been processed…."
"Can’t get a hold of any customer services, and occasionally when I do… they don’t know what they are doing.I ordered 3 items. I got sent 1 item and 1 incorrect item and now fighting for my money back. I am now getting a financial ombudsman involved as they are ignoring me from every angle. I will never be ordering from them again."
"Glad I didn’t read reviews before my order. My delivery came ahead of time, well packaged, good quality and a great fit. Will definitely shop there again"
"The customer service is absolutely appalling. I've not received my item, I have to jump through hoops to resolve the issue. I don't have a printer, they told me I should go to a friend's house instead. Nice"
"Awful customer service. Ordered a pair of boots for my husband, along with other items, totalling £150+. They come and despite being his regular size, are ridiculously small. Am told no exchanges, but I can return and reorder them, (a lot of hassle but was planning on doing this, until I realise they have gone up by £30.00). Email Zalando, asking if they will honour the price I paid for them less than 5 days ago to be told absolute nonsense, this being:""Unfortunately, we won’t be able to offer a price match for you on this occasion. I’m really sorry to let you down.In order to meet the requirements, the item needs to be identical. Unfortunately, the original price of these items across the different color/size were already different at the time of your initial purchase. This means that the price match requirements did not meet on this occasion, sorry about that!It is the exact same item, just one size up? It is less than 5 days ago I ordered them. There is no difference and the message they have sent makes no sense at all. Not happy and would not recommend.AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Will not use again."
Genuinely just have no words.. Ordered some trainers for my boy hermes lost the parcel waited 3 whole weeks!!! zalando refunded and gave me a 5% discount of next order. Went to place another order and they have changed price from £54.99 to £89.99!! For a pair of childrens uk size 13 trainers the adult sizes cost that much!!! ARE YOUU KIDDING ME. Literallyyy screwing people over rather not pay that price I will go elsewere thanks!😘
"Zalando has a wide selection of clothing at reasonable prices. They however insist on partnering with Hermes, quite possibly THE WORST delivery service in existence.I placed two orders on Zalando this year. The first item was apparently delivered. The delivery person even took a photo of the item on apartment letterboxes - all other delivery agents leave items with the concierge. On the cctv, the driver then took the item.This second order was similar. The driver claimed to have left the item in my porch - I live in a flat so have no porch! He did not even appear on the cctv.Zalando refunded me promptly but the use of Hermes means that I will never use zalando again."
"Ordered a pair of Ralph Lauren shoes which are a gift btw and they turned up in an unbranded plain cardboard box! How the hell am I supposed to give these as a gift. Absolute disgrace and waste of time. Was sent this lazy response when queried. Steer clear of Zalando unreliable & unprofessional! If the box has been damaged then the shoes probably have been too! Why on earth would you send someone that.Thanks for getting in touch.I'm sorry about that.Sometimes, when the original packaging's damaged warehouse replaces it with boxes like the one you have.In no way it means it's counterfeit.You can return it if it's not something you're okay with.We're unable to send you a new box.Have a great day!"
"I don’t understand why this website has only 2.7 stars!It’s simply perfect!The assortment is really wide and prices are very competitive.Also they give you 100 days to return you items. And returning products is even easier than Amazon, since products come directly with a returning label.I have bought 3 items and returned 2 (I bought multiple sizes and kept only one). The return has been quick as well as the refund!Honestly the service was impeccable.I will definitely re-use it endless times!"
"Personally, I do not understand the negative reviews at all!The prices are fantastic, it was delivered in a perfectly reasonable amount of time and the item was in top notch condition.I call that 5 star service so I had no issues at all and I’ll definitely be happy to use zalando again and will recommend to others"
The worst company I have ever used! 3 weeks of ringing and emailing and they still have my money for an order that was never fulfilled. Their customer service is absolutely shocking and they don’t seem to care about sorting it out at all. Never buy anything from Zalando if you want to receive your purchase or your money back x
"Superb! Five items of clothing bought over the last month and absolutely no issues with quality, delivery or service. Well informed of despatch, deliveries, etc and well packaged on arrival. I note that some feel the returns can be tricky due to Hermes. I haven't had to return via Hermes as yet and delivery has been top class.The clobber on Zalando is really varied and there are loads of out of season things I had contemplated buying but then missed due to procrastinating.These are my go to from now on for clothes and whatnot. Many thanks!!"
"Ordered 2 pairs of Reebok trainers from their website. Was a bit dubious as to some of the reviews, but all good and trainers arrived about 4 days after ordering 👍"
I use Zalando for most of my 8 year olds sons designer clothing & not once have I have any issues. Always receive a confirmation email once order is placed an then another when dispatched to that gives the estimated arrival time. Will continue to use Zalando & I would recommend.
"Another terrible experience on this site with Zalando customer service with Hermes - they really need a new delivery partner if they want to maintain any credibility at all. I ordered a dress that wasn't as described and when I tried to send it back, Hermes lied twice about me not being home when they came to collect it (when I was 3 metres from my front door and didn't pick up anyone on my Ring doorbell). Zalando was reasonably responsive and apologetic at first, and then just stopped responding to me and I'm now stuck sending the parcel back at my own expense using another service."
"Very terrible, ordered designer shoes, they sent me a completely different pair and not in my size. Complained and they basically called me a liar. I told them I've sent it back they refused me a refund and said they can send the same shoes back but nothing else. Appalled."
"Do not use this site!I was incredibly disappointed with the service (or lack of) provided by Zalando. I ordered a product on the 12 November with a promise that it would be delivered between 15-19 November. I have still NOT received it. Having followed up with the service desk, they said they would not be able to come back with an update until they had heard from their courier (Hermes) and this would take 5 days - this in itself is unacceptable. I have continued to ask for updates and no one has got back to me. They have not offered to refund me or send out a replacement as a matter of priority. I have found the experience incredibly frustrating - when you are spending a considerable amount of money on a product, you expect this to arrive within the promised timeframe and with a certain level of service. Do not use this to order products!!"
"There is still no signs of my order and no update from Hermes?! Enough is enough! You can send another pair URGENTLY please.We have waited and wasted the last 48 hours on top of previous 4 days of waiting for the supposedly lost driver to do his next day delivery? expecting a delivery THAT HAS CLEARLY BEEN STOLEN by Hermes staff!I wasn't surprised by the lack of professionalism from Hermes, as per usual, this is only another out of time frame delivery, but, I was expecting much better aftercare services from Zalando. YOU HAVE HAD MY PAYMENT FOR OVER 10 DAYS NOW and still showing no signs of urgency?! Not initiated contacted me in one single occasion?! You have my contact details, why am I not getting updated?No option to escalate my enquiry either as staff said we don't transfer calls to managers... I am fed up and feel like I have been scammed!PS: definitely not on the right track to make our world a better place by treating customers with this much disregard and disrespect ! You should focus on customer support and also change courier!The customers are not always right! but you are not even trying!?Many Thanks for such a waste of time and moneyAs you can tell by my review, I have had enough of all this pucking bullock between Zalando and schitty hermes delivery company! There surely is a way to get through to someone who gives a puck to solve this cluster puck of a display you and hermes have been conducting!?? Pucking put me in charge and with Hermes gone, all of this would have been avoided...This wasn't even your fault to start with! You send the order within 24h of me placing the order and now getting a bad name by association with useless funts! (And now showing your true colours through their lack of commitment)Feel free to call me on 017** *** *** or 077** *** *** (preferably landlines as network coverage is not great in our area.)Regards"
Racist against white people.Stay away from these racists
Appalling service!!  Ordered a watch at £100 & received a water bottle then they asked for personal information for me to makes a claim. Stay clear!!!!!
"Ordered during Black Friday and got confirmation email shortly afterwards. Then received email that order had been dispatched. Opened my emails this morning to see that they had received my return! I never got the item in the first place, not to mind returning it to them. Contacted customer service who said it was a logistics issue and not a problem on their side. They were unwilling to re-send my order which they had received back into the warehouse but told me I could re-order at the full price. Extremely disappointing"
"Lost a customer of years over a 8€ dispute.I've been a customer for years, everything is great until you have a problem, then you are on your own.Nice way to run a business, losing a customer who has spent thousand of euros to save you 8€ that could have kept me happy and continue spending more.But no worries, I'll happily take my money to other company, I hope those 8€ that you decided not to reimburhs me do you well.Advise for others, go away fast, there are other companies that will put you first."
I just want to know is the stuff on here real ?
Have ordered of these a few times the most recent time I brought trainers for £130 they cancelled the same night. However 13 days later and still no refund the customer service is beyond a joke they say it wasn’t taking yet the bank and my statements prove it was in holding and has now been sent them as cleared my bank. The bank has no notification of cancellation yet this company swear they have. I have called and spoke to a few people yet they all say something else one told me payment was declined and I never ordered 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ Avoid they will take your money and then stone wall the refund
By far the worst customer service. Avoid at all costs. You don't need this stress.
"never had a issue, get delivery and returns"
Always an excellent service & I go back regularly
"Just a ridiculous experience. The customer service is shockingly bad. I ordered items which I received promptly. I did not receive one item and they did not refund me for the item I did not receive. I spent over an hour talking to three different agents - two of whom were useless and just ignored me and stopped responding/spent ten minutes to reply to a message despite having seen it/kept asking me the same question. All of this just because of a mistake they made. I definitely won't be shopping here again, it's not worth the aggravation"
"Literally Pleased.This was my first experience with Zalando and I am literally pleased. Very good customer service. Unfortunately for me, I had to return one of the items I've bought, because the size was not a perfect fit for me. I needed some help from them, they replied in less than twenty four hours and I've got my refund very quick.I've read someone accusing Zalando of being a scam, in my opinion they are not a scam whatsoever and because of the good experience I've had, I am giving them a five stars reward.Good one Zalando."
"Dear paulina,I would love to leave your bunda looking like a milky way bar ya uckers baders lengers she knows she my boo thang, zalando your neeks if you fired my babes.Kind regards,Jeffery Epstein"
"Ordered a coat, company failed to deliver on 4 separate occasions. Told each time def arriving on next date .. but no 4 times! Customer service useless and give meaningless lip-service. Avoid this company they suck."
"Very quick delivery, come a day quicker then expected. The product was great to, free delivery aswell!"
Ordered some vans as a gift. 75.00 of vans website but 30.39 Inc delivery on this site.Easy to order and quick delivery.Recommended
"I’ve been trying to contact customer service For 3 weeks now. I returned my package via hermes drop off, I hve confirmation of drop off but until now it shows that it hasn’t been picked up - I contacted Hermes and they said it has to be dealt with Zalando. Emails or phone numbers don’t work, can I have my money back please? Order number 10504016195998"
Wow what a great service Doc Martins cheapest around was worried they might be fake but they are originals. Ordered on Thursday arrived Saturday cant get better than that.I have already recommended to a couple of friends who have placed orders Michele
Not particularly easy to find a customer service email; address - finally was able to contact zalando.Staff very unhelpful.  No understanding of good customer service.Prices however are good. If you can put up with the poor aftersales and enquiries response.
Have been using Zalando for about a year and have been really pleased with the clothes. They have a massive selection of items to choose from. As someone else mentioned delivery can be a little slower than other online shops but not massively different. I particularly like the details and description they give of the clothing which is far more than you usually get with other sites. Prices/discounts can change quickly so always check over a few days. Customer service is really good -only used it once as I'd not received my parcel and the item had been discounted online during the period of me buying and receiving the top. They refunded me the difference which was great.
"I've been shopping from Zalando for years and I've never really had any problems. I have always received my refunds even though it does take a little longer than other companies. The reason I am not giving 5 stars is that there is no express delivery option and as I mentioned above, the refund takes a bit long to come through."
"Great range of clothes, but out of my last 5 orders, I’ve returned stuff 4 times and never received a refund.You chase them up and they refuse to refund you until two weeks has passed, even if you have the Hermes receipt as proof it’s arrived back with them.Given them several bites at the cherry but had enough now, if it was a one off thing fair enough but it’s every time….do yourself a favour and use ASOS!!"
"Absolutely disgusted with this companyThe wallet I ordered never arrived,just an empty torn package.This had either been lost in transit or deliberately removed by someone.I told the company I hadn’t received the item but still not been refunded.Firstly they wanted me to download a legal form and when I told them i couldn’t do this but as stated in my email I was declaring I hadn’t had it.They then replied saying I had to sign the legal disclaimer AND send proof of my identity 😡Utterly ridiculous and still not been refunded."
One of my worst shopping experiences ever. This has completely put me off online shopping. This company has 0 customer services and they are huge liars. Save your money and shop elsewhere
"Ordered 2 sets of boots, really quick delivery…  sent one back as it didn’t suit me. Their refund progress is very quick!Definitely recommend them!"
"Absolutely delighted with everything. Great shoes, great price, ridiculously fast delivery. Faultless! Thank you 👍👍👍"
Appalling customer service. Item still not posted after 5 days. Took 25 mins to answer simple question as to why my item has not been shipped yet. And said they would try and locate it and will let me know in 5 days. I would advice do not but from this company.
Wanted a particular pair of sketchers trainers.£20 cheaper on Zalando than anywhere else. Ist time buyer on this site. So Glad I didn't check the reviews first. Everything was great .Hermes kept me up to date with delivery. 2 days earlier than  estimated. Given 2hr time slot for delivery and the trainers are brilliant. Very pleased.
"After now receiving my refund I feel I can safely write my review. I found a coat I loved on Zalando. I’d never ordered from here before so I checked these reviews which put me off. I looked everywhere else to see if they sold the same coat but no where did. Luckily I saw 2 positive reviews on mumsnet so decided to take the risk. I got the standard free delivery I ordered on a Tuesday night and got it by Saturday. The coat was exactly as ordered but just didn’t look nice on me. I arranged a return via Hermes, they received it 2 days later and I got my refund a couple of days after that. Honestly I don’t know if I just got lucky but I couldn’t fault them & would definitely order again."
I was nervous ordering from here because of how many bad reviews there were. Amazing service and exactly what I ordered. It came in around 5 days. The shoes were ten pound cheaper than other websites. So excellent prices and service including tracking. I am so so impressed.
"I have been a regular Zalando customer for some years and find their goods ok.The disaster happens when you need to return an item.If this is a ‘partner’who does not enclose a return label you are stuck.Zalando has only automatic emails not live,they continually refer you to FAQ’s of no use. There is no phone contact number and no ‘ chat’.  The only answer is to buy from someone else"
"If i could give them minus stars I would.Ordered an item approximately four weeks ago - waited two weeks and chased, was told that they could not fulfill the order and that they would cancel the hold placed on my funds - two weeks later still no sign of the money despite many e-mails, telephone conversations and chats. No empathy, no ownership re the problems - terrible terrible service."
"I cannot fault them. I ordered some boots which were dispatched and delivered within a week. Unfortunately they are partnered with Hermes who are the worst courier service out there. The Hermes delivery driver left the package in full view in my porch, which is a stupid thing to do as it was very obvious packaging that contains a fashion item (it says ""wear me, love me"" or something on the box). Even then it wouldn't have mattered but I had to attend an emergency on the day of delivery and wasn't back for several hours - so of course by the time I returned the package had been stolen by an opportunistic thief. I told all of this to Zalando and they simply agreed to refund me the full amount within 5 working days. I didn't think I would get anything back at all so am very happy!"
"I sent a return, had no refund and have been spending days and hours just to get to the customer service to find out what is going on."
"Still waiting on an order which was dispatched by zalando 10 days ago to Hermes and been stuck in their local depot apparently, zalando are not providing a refund until Hermes respond so it appears I will be waiting indefinitely. !! Zalando are ruining their reputation by appointing Hermes as their carrier . Very dissatisfied with being left hanging ! I will shop around now before choosing Zalando ."
"My honest review of Zalando is that is has usually been absolutely fine. Easy to order, delivered on time and responsive customer service. Recently there has been issues with the courier Hermès that they use which is letting them down. Although Zalando is happy to assist in resolving issues this is absolutely putting me off shopping with them in future. Got my refund of items never delivered but Zalando I want the items hence why I ordered. Really advice changing courier partner"
Had a good experience all the way through. Delighted with purchase and price.
The best site I've ever used to shop online
"❗️STOP USING MYHEMERS❗️STOP USING MYHEMERS !Stop sending luxury items and using myHermes do the maths,You guys I’ve got a great shop but your just ruining your company by using a cheap company to deliver peoples items to the UKGive customers the option to pay extra to get a faster or or liable delivery companyPLEASE GO BACK DHL OR TRY SOMEONE NEW PLEASE YOU CANT JUST KEEP USING HERMES OH MY GOD❗️❗️❗️"
This is the worst on line shopping experience I have received! I ordered two pairs of wellies and realised the next day that the auto fill had put in an old address.I tried to call the customer service ASAP to change the address and firstly they did not understand the problem as the customer service team could not understnad English well.. Eventually i managed to get someone who understood me and she explained there was nothing they could do to change the address. So now the products have been delivered to my old address and I do not have the products and Zalando are doing nothing about a refund! They keep telling me to send the products back!! They are useless and terrible and I will never order from them again. They have ignorant and evasive tactics when dealing with customers with any issues.
"Ordered pair of trainers that where no where in stock anywhere else and discontinued. I was quite worried after placing my order due to reading the horror reviews. Maybe I got lucky. I ordered on a wednesday, received email for tracking the Saturday delivered by hermes monday. Legitimate box legitimate product right size etc so bang on the money. Maybe I got lucky but for me one very happy customer and will likely order again. My hermes driver is also the main man very professional always delivers so perhaps some people have shady drivers in their area. Zalando an hermes good job 👍"
Excellent service.  My item was given a 5 days window.  It arrived on the 1st day. The packaging was the original from Nike. There was also an outer packaging which was very good.I would definitely recommend this company
Zalando is the best online shopping service that has ever existed.Hassle free returns and good service.I wish every brand would just move their whole online store to Zalando.
I can’t relate to the bad reviews I order from this company all the time and the items always come with a email and on time the items come well packaged with care it’s a really good company to order from its amazing .
Such a bad experience! Still waiting 280£ for my North Face jacket money refund! Its been almost 3 weeks. They started ignore my emails! I have all proofs and wont leave like this :) but guys! Be careful!
"I bought a ralph lauren belt from here, they delievered the competely wrong one! and then said that they might not have the actual one in the warehouse. WELL THEN TAKE IT OFF YOUR WEBSITE THEN!!! In return of the inconvenience they gave me a 15% discount if i order again. like that discount is going to do much! wont be ordering from here again!!!!! (oh and the belt seemed like a fake)"
My new favourite place to buy shoes from 🤩I placed two separate orders over the past 2 weeks & I’m very satisfied!Both orders I received promptly with no issues!I will be ordering again - thanks Zalando!
"Thanks God that such reviews exist - I dont know anything about Zalando and was ready to place an order with them. But I cannot take take the risk based on what I have read. Shame as the products look good, but I have to put my trust in those customers who have dealt with them before. That's the whole purpose of these reviews."
"I ordered 6 pairs of shoes to try different styles and sizes. Kept 1 and returned 5. Zalando confirmed receipt of the parcel but refunded me for 2 only. When I emailed them asking for money, they are asking me to scan and send my photo ID along with a form. Do retailers have right to the data within photo IDs? I am raising a dispute through my payment provider, reporting zalando to the police for scam and sharing my story online on various platforms to see if anything else can be done to get my money back; is there anything else can be done to correct the retailer misbehaviour?"
"I ordered medium shorts and received small. I called up to get the correct size and was told I'd need to reorder. I explicitly asked Zalando to confirm that if I ordered a size M, I would receive shorts with M on the label, I was told yes.I reordered medium shorts, and again received small. Disgraceful customer service and, as far as I can see, pathetic company in general."
"I made an order in July, decided to return all the items. Zalando confirmed the items had been received, agreed to refund me in full. Then I noticed that I was only credited a partial refund. When asked for explanations, Zalando admitted that there had been a mistake and promised to send me the rest of the refund promptly. It's late October and I'm yet to see the rest of my money. I have contacted customer service several other times, by email, about this and they did not even reply anymore (I guess no more pretenses eh? Let it be out in the open that your behaviour is predatory)."
I’ve never had a problem with them.
"all items came within 3 days, customer service was absolutely amazing when I had slight issue with the order, sorted it out straight away. many thanks will definitely be shopping here again"
"SCAM BEWARE !They trick you in 50% promo which discontinues the following day, not the first time but definitly the last time, I will delete your app and never use your platform to buy anything again."
"Warning- Please refrain from using Zalando for any order as their customer service is despicable. I had ordered 2 pairs of shoes and paid for them online. All done and simple. I received the order via Hermes a week later with 2 boxes- 1 with a pair of shoes and the other absolutely empty. I called them and they said it was an error by the packaging team. However, the required size was out of stock. I lodged an official complaint and ask for a redelivery of the item free of cost as compensation or a voucher so that I can use it later and they gave a meager 20% discount as if I am going to use them again. They are terrible at customer service and have no value for the business."
"There is essentially no customer service to speak of.... which is made even worse by the fact that they use Hermes for delivery who ALSO have almost no customer service.My items took over 3 weeks to arrive, only after many emails sent with next to no replies. From other reviews sounds almost like a scam - and such a shame since in Germany Zalando is great!"
"I’m disappointed with my experience, bad customer service, delayed delivery, lost of items.I don’t recommend Zalendo at all."
Everything I've ordered has arrived on time and has been great quality and fits well. I'll be purchasing more from them in the future
"I often order some items on Zalando and I think Zalando's Customer Service is one of the best - always very helpful with quick response.   The items are certainly real, high quality and quick delivery.  I like Zalando very much and will keep shopping.  Highly recommend this shop."
"Not a good experience. I bought multiple items that cost over £400 and when the parcel came empty I contacted them about it. They then said that I need to send over id, so I sent over my photocard and a card with my signature on it and they said it wasn’t sufficient ID. So when they finally accepted the ID they said I have to file a police report which isn’t helpful at all because what can the police do about missing clothes that were missing before they came to me? They’re not refunding me it’s literal robbery, it’s being made so hard to get your money back that you just give up. But now I’m £460 down and they’re not doing anything about it. Do not buy from them because their logistics and customer service is probably the worst I’ve experienced."
"Excellent, I would give 10stars if possible, this is my first experience with zalando, and I will make it my go to website, after this smooth experience, emails, super fast delivery, plsd I didn't take on board a couple of bad reviews, thankyoo so much, quality garment also."
"Dreadful service. Waited for a week for a delivery, then got told that it was ""returned"" but the item had gone up in price."
They don't care about uk consumer law or there customers. Based in Germany. Missing items using there click and collect service. Refused to refund me or replace the missing items. They asked me to contact the police and get a crime number. Police said it is a civil matter. Stuck in limbo. If you choose to use them make sure you use a credit card to purchase. Then you will have some form of protection.
"Awful experience. Ordered two pairs of shoes, kept one pair and returned one pair. After two weeks of chasing the unhelpful customer experience staff suggested i did not return the shoes i ordered and i am still awaiting the Zalando warehouse team to come back to me with evidence. The customer service team offered me no help or assistance to resolve this issue at all also.. I would recommend no-body uses this company."
"Great company, great service, easy return process.."
Gave me the complete wrong random item which was needed as a present urgently now the item is out of stock
"Great service. I ordered my shoes and they came promptly, as delivery date promised. Shoes were lovely and the fit was exactly as expected. Would definitely buy from them again.Product: Anna Field platform heels."
"I've never hand any bad issues with this website, stuff gets here fast and it's good for deadstock stuff, though I haven't used the returns system recently so take this with a grain of salt."
I Ordered a few items from Zalando. Returned them and only got a partial refund. Despite having a Hermes return slip as proof of return.£92 of my money has gone down the drain and despite numerous emails they have refused to refund the full amount unless I send them my ‘photo ID’ and sign a ‘legal declaration form’ in order for them investigate the problem with their warehouse employees. This request is absurd and against uk consumer rights as they are not a financial company. Consumer rights states that When you return an item within 14 days you should get an automatic refund without any need for ID. I’ve never experienced or had such request from any other company.. ever!I went to citizens bureau for advice but they were unable to help me because Zalando is based in Germany so I can’t even take them to the small claims court in the UK. Sickening that they just get away with taking peoples hard earned money with no consequences.Do yourself a favour and shop elsewhere and Avoid the Money grubbing Scum of a company that is Zalando That does not follow UK consumer law
I am still waiting for my refund from Zalando even though I didn’t get my items sent out to me but they think it ok to keep my money & all they said is be patient. It’s very easy Zalando if you don’t give out the items then you give the customer the money back. Customer service is a joke nobody cares & they all act like robots. I want my money back Zalando do you here me!!!!!! If Zalando come back saying you have to wait for what!!! Some shoes that never arrived!!!!
Just received the best level of customer service I have ever had from a company from their agent Oliver. I sent an email querying a refund problem and received a reply 5 minutes later resolving the problem. I normally have to wait days for a resolution to issues like this and to receive such a quick response was such an unexpected surprise! Very happy to continue to purchase from Zalando prompted by my experience today.
Shocking customer service. Hermes have admitted to both me and zalando that parcel is lost in transit yet still no refund without having to fill out a lengthy form?! And 'managers don't deal with customers'AVOID!!! UNLESS YOU WANT HASSLE!!
"Awful customer service! I have received an item which smells like hell! Absolutely awful chemical smell! It made me very nauseous, I had to keep the item in the garden shed while I reported this as faulty, but they said it is not their problem, they said it is normal!!!"
absolutely woeful.i used zalando a lot and used to be a great experience but now its a joke.ordering shoes and being sent ones 2 and a half sizes to small because they didn't have the size they advertised so your sitting in for hours waiting for shoes then having to return them the next day.just refund people if you haven't got the size!3rd time now and won't be using any more.
I wanted to leave this review as I was so nervous buying from this company due to the many bad reviews it has but it was the only place that sold the trainers that I wanted so after a lot deliberation i placed my order and hoped for the best!My order arrived after a couple of days as confirmed my the emails they sent.. The order was packaged well and the trainers in brand new condition (as you would expect) so overall it’s a 5* from me.
"To be fair, I've always had a good experience with Zalando, and I've had an account with them for a while. When they don't have my size in an item, I get an email within a couple weeks or so to let me know there's more available. Returns and deliveries are fast too. Recently, had a faulty item that I didn't think I can resolve since I've been using it for a bit, but the team was super fast to reply and helped me resolve."
I found it easy to order and it has arrived quickly - I'm glad the bad reviews didn't stop me from ordering. My son absolutely loves his new shoes and I had no issues at all. Will definitely buy again.
"Please Do Not Order From Zorlando, Lost My Package and Never Told Me! Still Waiting For Refund, It’s Unreliable and It Isn’t Gauranteed You Will Even Get What You Paid For"
THE MOST horrific customer service ever. Please DO NOT order from this online retailer ever. Unless you want them to steal your money and then deal with rude chat employees. They owe me £130 refund for over 3 weeks now and are still not able to tell me when they'll refund me the money! WORST online retailer. Just go to Amazon or Asps where they actually provide you with a customer service and most importantly refund!!!!!
Courier never picked up my parcel. I wasted actually two days. I had to order another courier since the first one never picked up my parcel. And guess what... the second one did not show up either.
"Zalando are a lovely Company to deal with  unfortunately recently I had a parcel lost in transit but Zalando immediately refunded the money.    I have however, dealt with them on several occasions and they are efficient and businesslike to deal with.  I certainly will be using them again.    Norma"
"Very disappointing experience I do not recommend to anymore, strongly suggest to avoid and go somewhere else. I have purchased a Valentino bag for my mums birthday and it was a big thing for me as they are very expensive but I wanted to treat her. When the package arrived it looked like it was ran over by a lorry, it was open so I didn’t know if someone accessed it or even swapped it as that’s how big the whole was. The customer service was terrible made me feel stupid and not valued at all as a customer. Very sad and very disappointed"
"Just realised this year will be ten years, or very close to ten, when I first discovered Zalando in the UK. And today, a decade later, they still remain my 'go-to' fashion website.Zalando really have tailored (pun intended!) their product ranges with an unrivalled mix of brands from budget to prestige so it's almost certain you’ll find what you want, at a price you’re happy with. This said I do tend to look on some of the other fashion sites but, with the odd exception, always come back and order from Zalando.What’s essential to me is being able to order, with free delivery*, in a few different sizes so I get the right fit knowing I can return the other/s for a no-quibble refund which, incidentally, is usually repaid in a few days.Thank you Zalando for the last ten years... I raise my glass to you for the next ten!*Just checked and currently, at 15th September 2021, delivery and returns are both free for orders above £19.90."
I have requested a refund for an order I never received. Zalando state theyre waiting for their courier to return the items. Two weeks have gone by since my order. This delay is not my fault yet Zalando continue to deny me the refund that I'm entitled to. Disgraceful.
Ordered a Ralph top on 10th August - hemmes say they delivered on 13th but all they can send me is picture of closed front door.  When I get home no parcel.  I contact Zalando who apprently send a replacement when I chase this up I get photo of a complete different home?   I contact again to eventually get a form to fill in.  I chase again to be told I’ve given wrong order number ( I didn’t) and they don’t know what hasn’t been delivered.  The only thing this year I have ordered!! I’m still awaiting response a month later. I will never order again
"Unbelievable I RECEIVED  AN EMAIL AT 07:20 SAYING MY ORDER WILL BE DELIV BETWEEN 11:00 AND 13:00 AND THEN 15 MINUTES LATER I HAVE SOME HERMES DE GUY RINGING MY DOORBELL WHILST HALF MY FAMILY ARE ASLEEP AND THE OTHER HALF ARE GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL, AND THEN TO TOP IT OFF THE GUY LEAVES MY PARCEL OUTSIDE BUT THE DELIVERY INFO SAYS HE PUT IT THROUGH MY LETTER BOX, WHAT A JOKE! I won’t be ordering from here again that’s for sure"
"I am appalled by the delivery service and Zalando's customer service's lack of willingness to properly take rresponsibility. Our box was left between the bins next to our building:- someone was at home, the buzzer did not ring-location not next to front door- package got absolutely soaked by the rain. Shoe box very damp too-due to location was nearly thrown away by neighbour as they just saw a badly damaged box on floor.Zalando apologised and offered  15% off my next £60 purchase.  I don't currently £60 to spend on clothes or shoes in one go, 10% money back on what I had spent would have been gratefully appreciated.I will not buy from them again."
"This company is fantastic and in touch all the way, from ordering to returning. I’m very impressed with them and highly recommend them"
"Awful customer service!!!I ordered £200 worth of products.When the parcel arrived it was clear it hadn’t been sealed properly, due to this the bag worth £70 I had ordered was missing. On top of that the £80 trainers were sent in the wrong size.I eventually got a refund for the bag after filling in a form.When I sent the trainers and a pair of jeans I’d ordered back I received an email stating they won’t refund due to receiving an ASOS dress and Primark trainers back.Regardless of my concern they refuse to refund me and listen to what has clearly been a break of trust in their warehouse staff.I wonder how many other customers have experienced the same issue!!!!"
"Writing this again because Truspilot DELETED MY GENIUNE REVIEW. Of a legitimate experience that happened!I bought an item on sale, Zalando UK *refused* to send me a replacement when they told me (after weeks) that it was lost in transit. They would ONLY give me the option to buy it again at a much higher price- even though I've already bought it! Seems like a shady practice.Zalando took my order, pretended to despatch it. The courier said they never even received the package, so it cannot have been.The customer service was absolutely terrible, the worst I've ever received and I will never forget it. I spoke to 3x representatives before I luckily, eventually got someone helpful. The 3x before would not listen to what I was saying and kept trying to process a refund which I repeatedly kept saying I do NOT authorise. I believe the third person just did it anyway even though I told them not to & I was going to investigate further.Trustpilot, can I really trust you to not delete my genuine review again? I'm disgusted that you would try to cover up bad reviews that are completely legitimate, it's really changed my opinion of your company. So you can delete this review if you want- just understand that I will save this and continue to upload it if you choose to do so."
"After months of searching for a branded formal dress sold out on every other major platform website, I finally found what I was looking for on Zalando discounted. The dress was dispatched quickly and the item was well packaged."
"I was sent the wrong size of an item I ordered which I needed for a wedding. The only solution they were able to offer was for me to return the item and reorder it. This was not a practical solution for me given the time the process would take and I don't feel is acceptible customer service, given that they made the mistake. I would therefore not recommend ordering items if you need them within a short time frame, as you cannot be guaranteed to receive what you order, or receive assistance in getting the item you have ordered in the time frame advertised. I should note that the customer service was polite and prompt but the outcome of the issue fell short of my expectations."
"Overall they have a great choice and I used to order plenty. However, you're on your own if there are any delivery issues - i.e. parcel is lost, you need to divert it. The customer service don't have any options to contact Hermes themselves and the solution is always the same, wait for the parcel to return to us and get a refund in 14 days. You can get much better customer assistance from other retailers."
"I was carried away by the marketing of Zalando pre-owned. However, their marketing about the second-hand clothes is misleading. On the website they literally write I cite: ''All pre-owned Zalando items are individually checked to ensure they are as good as new, with no visible defects or signs of frequent use''. The is absolutely not true. I received more than 10 articles and all of them where visibly used which you couldn't see on the picture. The clothes also smelled badly: perfume, moldy smell. The clothes aren't washed at all, such a shame. It definitely breaks the experience of buying second hand clothing on Zalando. The smell of these clothes is as follows: unwashed clothes that all get cramped up in some dusty warehouse and it all stinks like secondhand clothes with sweat, mold, dust, perfume. The smell ingrains into the clothes so disgusting. I I literally had to wash my body afterwards and clean my room, cause I also saw dust and dander flying off the clothes and hairs here and there. Yes it is that bad. I will not be surprised if there are vermin there where they store the second hand clothes. I have much greater experiences buying second hand clothing on physical shops.I don't recommend you buying ever from Zalando pre-owned / Zalando second hand / Zalando Zircle. The clothes are also too expensive for what you get. Returning the second hand clothes is also a hazzle, not as fast as when buying and returning NEW clothes through Zalando.Bottom line don't EVER order from Zalando pre-owned / Zalando second hand / Zalando ZircleOrder new clothes instead or go to your local second hand shop. support small business owners and not Zalando Circle that offering too expensive secondhand clothes just to make themselves richer which they already are."
"I am a very happy Zalando customer since 20 years and buy about 90% of my clothes and shoes at Zalando. Great and easy to use app, love the alert option for out of stock items.Wide range of brands, often with amazing discounts.I had the odd issue with a delivery, but Zalando's customer service has always gone out of their way to solve the issue and earned my trust."
"My go-to online retailer.A lot of choices, many brands and for every budget.Delivery is quick and sending back is easy."
"I ordered a £400 Marccain dress and it arrived in a plastic bag 10"" by 8"" all screwed up and very very creased. Shameful packaging."
Ordered a Valentino bag and it was “lost” by Hermes. Thought I’d give them another try and order the same bag again … and again same thing. Waste of time. Change your courier Zalando ..
"Great online retailer, good selection of brands, very easy to navigate the website and order.They offer free returns, and when I needed the customer service has replied and solved to high standards any issue.Returns are very easy as packages bring a prepaid label and you can use their own packaging for returns.  Refunds are processed quickly.Sometimes they do not have all sizes, however, they notified you when it is back on stock.Fast delivery and with no issues."
Ordered my son a pair of Nike air max they came with blue pen an grass stains all over them an was told I coudnt get a refund paid 60 for some used air max disgraceful company avoid woudnt get anything from here when they have the cheek to send you used trainers
"Ordered a pair of Nike air zoom type trainer's.Was sent a pair in a non Nike box way to small for the item, they had been bent to squeeze them in the box.The soles are all creased, marks on the sole, looks like they have been worn.Absolutely shocking and would never use again."
"Very satisfied with this company, customer service responds quickly to solve any query.Shopping here is easy. They have a great selection of brands and returns are free."
"I had never heard of Zalando before. I Googled ""slim denim jacket"" and their jackets popped up. I hastily ordered, but then panicked after the order went through. I wondered if the company was dodgy, so I came to check on Trustpilot...and was horrified. The reviews were awful, and I made my peace with the fact that I would probably never get my goods. Lo and behold, 3 days later, as per the specified delivery date (Fri 15th Aug 2021), my jacket arrived and it was perfect! They didn't prompt me to write a review, they only sent an email for a review on their own website, but I came to Trustpilot to share my experience to allay any fears a prospective customer might have. this is not to say the other reviews are untrue, because  I believe them, but my own experience has been extremely positive. If i order again, and its a bad experience, I'll be back here to vent!!"
"I was unsure if I should use this company based on some of the reviews. However, delivery was prompt, early in fact and communication was on point. I would use them again based on my experience."
"I'd never heard or used this site before but I saw something I liked and decided to give it a go. The item I got was a good fit, well but not overly packaged so can't complain.Easy ordering, updates and delivery. Super happy to give this 5 stars and I'd happily based on this initial experience use them again."
"Arrived very quickly within delivery timescale.The Vivienne Westwood dress - which was on sale - was sold out everywhere else, I was initially skeptical about buying via Zalando given the customer reviews on trustpilot. However, I was pleasantly surprised, the item arrived on a Friday (it was ordered on Tuesday) right at the start of the delivery timescale slot. So all in all, a happy customer."
I was worried about ordering because of the bad reviews but decided to take a chance as Zalando was only place to order a particular Nike bag I wanted for school. Well I needn't have worried as it has arrived well within the timescale stated so i am really happy. I would order again in the future.
"I had a new pair of boots for Xmas and by June they were starting to come apart from the bottom seem, the boots weren’t cheap so I would expect them to last longer. The company told me they could not help me in any way as I’d had them for 7 months even though for 2 months I hardly wore them as it was sunny and to warm to do so."
"Ordered five different packs of men’s briefs from brands like Levi’s etc. Arrived in a timely way, we’ll packaged and no issues!"
If I could give 0 stars I would im absolutely disgusted by the item I received and the customer service I was believed for it to be brand new with tags and in fact it was used and has body fluid on it ? I don’t get how they can get away with this they say they regulate there items… they clearly haven’t regulated or just don’t care? As long as they get the money? And the customer service is shocking I want a refund and instead they have gave me a “10 % discount off for my next order they didn’t even seemed shocked by this  I won’t be ordering from them again so they can keep there 10% off
"I have always had great service from Zalando - quick delivery and seamless returns process. I appreciate people can be quite vitriolic at the arms length of a computer when things go wrong. Things do go wrong, thats life, but other online retails could learn a thing or two from their processes."
"The single worst customer service experience I have ever suffered through, placed an order to the wrong address rang up a day later and was told it was cancelled and I would be refunded in two days, after the two days I saw my order didn't update so I rang in again only to be told the order had been delivered and my refund would be held to ransom unless I fill in legal forms after having multiple agents be disgustingly rude to me and having had 80 calls hung up on trying to resolve this issue"
"BEWARE DONT GO NEAR THIS SITE! WORSE COMPANY EVER, RECEIVED INCORRECT SIZE OF TRAINERS AND NO REFUND GIVEN EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY YOU CAN GET A FULL REFUND, TRIED CALLING A FEW TIMES BUT LINE GOES DEAD AFTER 11 MINS EACH TIME. TRIED EMAILING BUT JUST GET FOBBED OFF. £120 DOWN. DO NOT TOUCH THIS SITE"
"I ordered a watch for my husband on 1st August as a birthday present. Today is 10th August and I haven't received the order. It seems HERMES have the item and they are refusing to deliver it for whatever reason. My personal view is the HERMES have misplaced the order or someone has stolen the item. This is frustrating 😤.Update: As of 15th August still no order and no communication from Zalando.Update: I emailed them today (15th) and my fears were confirmed.Reply;Unfortunately, our courier partner has notified us that your order  has been lost on the way to you. I'm so sorry about this! We're unable to resend the order so I've refunded the full order amount back to your original.Disappointed in HERMES, I will not be ordering anything of significant value online and I will tell my neighbours too.Worst online shopping experience for me."
Ordered a hat and gloves for my partner and arrived very quickly and great quality so no complaints here..
"A hideous experience, ordered 3 dresses, filled in the online info to return 3 dresses. Sent the 3 dresses via Hermes and was only credited for 2. Rang to speak to customer services and told to send Hermes receipt and fill in a legal disclosure form. Having then returned these documents I’m told I need to send photographic ID. with an expiry date. Passport, ID card or Driving licence, non of which I have. Then told if I don’t have these documents I can’t have a refund, many emails and calls later I still haven’t received a refund. To add insult to injury they sent an email to say the dress I liked is now back in stock in my size!!!!!!!! It was completely sold out, SOMEONE MUST HAVE RETURNED IT."
"First time buyer, saw some DMs in the sale and trainers and quickly bought them and then saw the reviews ( most people do it the other way round) and thought ""oh no"" was filled with dread and thinking the worst about my purchases but by the end of that day i had both tracking numbers ( sent in 2 parcels as they were in different locations) one arrived the day after and the other 2 days later, the boxes were interested boxes so that my whole purchase was intact and i honestly couldn't be happier with my items. I haven't needed to use customer services so i can't vouch for them but i was informed on my parcels every step of the way. If i had seen the reviews first i wouldn't have bought from Zalando but I'm so glad i did. The only gripe is using Hermes for delivery, they can be a nightmare company but I'm not knocking stars off for that as i had no issues on this occasion. I would definitely shop here again but use paypal or credit card just in case something goes wrong i can get my money back"
"Zero starsPlease don’t waste your time with this company. I am a FIRST time customer and NEVER again will I order from them. My order was placed on the 28/7/21 delivery timescale was 30/7/21-2/8/21 and today is the 6/8/21. Nobody can tell me what’s going on. On 3/8/21 I spoke to someone from Zalando they said I will be updated in 24/48 hour. Nothing. I haven’t been able to get through the worst courier company I’ve ever come across HERMES, save yourself the bother. I wish I read the reviews before ordering. Next time I’ll head down to a reputable company.UPDATE: They’ve lost the parcel!!"
"First time trying to shop at Zalando. Offers me to pay with invoice but denies me when i choose it. Ask support in chat, get a stickie, i tell him i´ve already read the extra info about why i cannot pay with invoice, but non of the information applies to me. Support simply won´t give me a genuine answer to my question. Horrible service. Not gonna bother shopping there again."
Ordered two pairs of jeans. Delivered quickly via DPD but as they obviously sold out of one of the pairs in the correct size they just sent me another incorrect pair - right size - wrong style - didn't fit. So rather than addressing the issue before despatch the warehouse person just picked any old rubbish to send. Creates work for me and Zalando have my money for an extra couple of weeks.
"Have bought and returned several items from zalando. Speedy delivery and never had any issues with delivery or returns being processed. Find their petite range very good , far better than what is on the high street ."
"Completely useless site. I had an user there that out of nowere got banned. I have tried to ask for a reason, but they wont give me one. I am never going to buy something from there again."
"I had the app on my phone for a while decided to give it a go order shoes and few polo tops.. Dispatched but no show.. Delivery is terrible, they use hermes which is the worst delivery company. Will not buy again.. I hope i get my things or will ask for a refund. 👎👎👎"
"Great store, excellent quality products and good prices. One of my fav shops but I just wished they stop working with Hermes and use a different delivery company."
I think this might be one of my favourite websites to buy clothes….. very easy delivery and returns. I’ve found them very speedy and returns have been easy.
"I have ordered many times from zalando. I can say that the delivery was always on time and the products were as expected. But this time they disappointed me.I'm expecting a parcel that it should be delivered by Hermes, but for almost 3 days now, they say that there's a delay and that it will be on the move shortly. I contacted zalando about this and they say that they can't contact Hermes because they don't have their phone number!!! This is outrageous!Zalando say that I should wait 5 days for an update from the courier!It's the second time that Hermes fail to deliver the products from zalando, because they lost them or whatever!Also, their live chat has technical problems and I can't carry on the conversation with the agent!Very poor customer support!I might not shop again from them"
"Ordered several weeks ago and no item, plus no response from emailing them. Raised a claim with PayPal and they respond within minutes. Apparently my parcel is lost in transit (shocking) and they have refunded me but I won’t see it unless I close my dispute with PayPal. Honestly these people think I was born yesterday! Close it so I no longer have PayPal to chase this? Now escalated further to PayPal, and I’ll let them issue my refund!!Update - PayPal closed the case in my favour and I have now received a refund. Lot of unnecessary hassle. Wish I had checked reviews before I purchased"
"ordered twice now from them, had a issue with one of the orders as was faulty, i left a message with their dedicated page and a picture, and they refunded me within 90 minutes (i used a giftcard so quicker than back to card). very pleased"
"Sent a return back via DPD and sent proof of delivery and a photo but they advised me as it was not Hermes they could not process the return. Customer service was the worst I have ever experienced, would not let me speak to someone senior. So they have my money and the item back. Someone needs to look into this I have never had this experience with any other online company."
"I’ve had bad experiences with retail companies before but nothing like this one with Zalando! Absolutely disgusting, it was so horrible I am wasting my precious time to write this review so people are aware when they come to buy from this company if they ever need help with something that’s the kind of customer spirit they will receive. It’s an absolute scam. First they refuse to acknowledge that my parcel was left outside near the bins claiming their delivery partner has delivered (obviously hermes). Then they ask for my picture in order to investigate this further, what they should be doing is investigating with their dear delivery partner the careless service provided from that delivery driver. I call them up to discuss this with them as i am not comfortable with providing my picture to a retail company, an agent called Mario working from home concludes that we will just be going in circles if i don’t provide my picture and tells me he will be ending the call as he does not want to talk anymore, bear in mind i was not rude at all to the agent and they can listen to that call, he only has a right to terminate the call if i was offensive or rude, of which I was neither. Then I call again and an agent called Cynthia says i can send an ID without showing my picture. Such conflicting information provided by the Agents. They’re no better on email aswell. Will not be purchasing from this place anymore there are plenty of better options out there."
Returned unused shoes. They refused to pay me back claiming they have signs of use. Complete fraud. Never had problems before but after this situation won't use them again!
Customer Service not very helpful and extremely rude when unable to resolve the technical issue the girl hung up.
Totally happy with the Zalando UK delivery service and the quality of the product (Asics trainers). The product arrived on time as per Zalando's estimate and the Asics trainers were the expected standard.
"Absolutely rubbish companyDo not shop from ZalandoTry alternatives like YOOX, Childsplay Clothing or Children SalonAlex Lee a customer service agent couldn't be bothered to helpI strongly recommend not shopping from Zalando, they do not value customers"
"I ordered a pair of jeans from Zalando and they were delivered by Hermes to a parcel locker, but unfortunately, Hermes failed to send the email with the required QR code that would allow me to retrieve the parcel and I was informed by Zalando that the only thing to do would be to wait for them to be returned to Zalando, at which point I would receive a credit for the jeans within 14 days. I wasn't happy with this, but had no choice but to go along with it. Several days later I received another notification that the jeans had once again been delivered to the locker, but still no email with the required QR code. Once more, I have to wait for the jeans to be returned to Zalando's warehouse and up to 14 days more to receive my refund, by which point it could be 5 weeks  from ordering the jeans to receiving my refund and all because Zalando's chosen courier (Hermes) have failed to deliver (twice). Not acceptable, very poor service!!!!"
I bought a chain for £75 which wouldn't fit round my wrist never mind my neck. I returned it to zalando using royal mail tracked and signed for delivery. The refund never updated so I contacted zalando several times to which they said they had not received it and so there was nothing they could do. I have contacted royal mail who provided the proof but that isnt good enought for Zalando so I am £75 out of pocket. I will never use them again.
"I ordered two things in one parcel: sneakers and leggings. I got my sneakers in 3 days ans was waiting for leggings for a week and still nothing. They sent me information that there couldn’t find my address. BUT IT WAS THE SAME FOR 2 ITEMS. How could it be that the first one could find and second one not. They said that they will return my money in 2-3 days, but I still have NOTHING!!! Terrible!!! No parcel, no money"
"Do not use this company, they sent trainers via Hermes who confirmed that they have lost the item and to provide evidence that they have been lost so I can get a replacement or refund. The team who are not very helpful said that they cannot do that and they have to wait another 4 days to 'investigate' even though I have an email confirmation that the item has been lost. PATHETIC!!!"
"It’s just terrible. I ordered a lot of items and a few days after I got an email saying that they don’t have enough tank tops, so it was cancelled. After that, I had to call 3 times the carrier that they’re using to deliver the items as the parcel was late and I didn’t receive sms with a code, so I could pick up my parcel. And just as a cherry on the top of it- I received black sandals instead of pink ones, so now half of my package is useful as I was suppose to match those clothes with my pink sandals. Just appalling."
Superfast delivery item much cheaper than local retailers. Highly recommended.
"Returned some Adidas Slides I ordered which weren't suitable, I liked the style and colour, they were too loose and felt like they would fall off my feet when walking.The return print out sent with them was faint and blurry, the staff at the Post Office had a hard time trying to scan the barcode and nearly didn't accept the parcel. I have a feeling that my parcel will not make it to the return depot. I feel fed up. :("
"I've been ordering from Zalando fairly regularly since 2019 (it's now halfway through 2021) and have only had positive experiences. I really like how you can see customer ratings and reviews for each individual item, as it's useful to help make better purchasing decisions. There are also notice pop-ups on items if the fit is smaller or larger than normal. My only complaint would be the size guides - considering they're a marketplace that retails A LOT of different brands, rather than having one generalised size guide, they should ensure that each (clothing and footwear) brand that signs up submits their own size guide. That way the sizing information would be more accurate. Other than that, delivery's always by Hermes and whilst I have a really good local Hermes courier, if you do not, this could be a potential issue worth noting. Returns are easy and straightforward, however I've never had to deal with Customer Service so I'm biased. Would be nice if Zalando implemented a points/reward system for those of us who shop on their site regularly. Also, there's only standard delivery option which sucks, because it would be better to offer a Next Day delivery option, however I've never had to pay for delivery on Zalando - it's always free. Overall, I 100% recommend :)"
"Hi, from time to time I buy from  zalando not alot of products but after what happened. this is my last time and l will be deleting the app, and the reason is I've order 2 items rather than sending the 2 items together you sent them separately and charge me for one. I Don't agree with that. so thats the reason why I'm not order from them again.."
"Gosh, I am feeling very nervous. Have just ordered a really pretty looking dress and was feeling very happy about it. But the reviews are very disheartening. If I have a pleasant surprise, I will certainly post a warm review. So far - ordering and viewing - all good...."
"My first ever order from Zalando consisted of two pairs of shoes, one pair arrived on time, but there was a delay with the other pair. It transpired that the 2nd pair were lost by their courier partner in transit. I had liaised with Customer Service a few times via email regarding my order and got an almost immediate response back the Zalando Team every time. Refund processed straightaway. This exceptional level of customer service give me the confidence to continue shopping with Zalando!"
"I have read some negative reviews and compared to my experience they seemed opposite to what I feel about zalando. I ordered 2 pairs of trousers for my son, 1 was great and to this day its the best trousers he ever had, the other one was a bit too big although imo it looked great and nice quality but my son said NO , so I send it away to get a refund. After a month after sending I didnt get the money so I called and was told that the parcel never arrived though they have the confirmetion it was sent. So  I was issued with the refund straight away (next day in my account) so even with such a hold up once I explained the situation there was no problem. So in my opinion their customer service deserves a credit and the trousers quality was really great. I would honestly recommend them and just to add I have dealt with some really dodgy companies like LUXPLUS=thieves."
terrible service it takes them forever to even send an order and support just tells you if you don't like something just cancel the order we don't care. don't waist your time and order some place else
"I have used this site a few times, many years a go so looked at the reviews & was slightly worried but did order a pair of MK shoes, they have arrived within 2 days & are perfect"
This company is a dodgy Chinese company selling rubbish rather than improving quality they are paying people to leave good reviews I would love to add pictures of how Chinese companies con their way in to the market by lying but I don’t have the option of leaving pictures unfortunately this needs to be addressed boycott Chinese junk
They attract customers with low prices and then send parcels with missing products! Do not buy from this website
I’m a long time customer and I feel I need to defend Zalando and all the bad reviews. I’ve been shopping with them for over 5 years and never had any issues. Any queries I had were resolved by the super efficient Customer Support team. Returns are really easy and refunds are processed promptly. I feel like people are more inclined to leave bad reviews when they are disgruntled but not a positive review when the service is as expected. The updates are prompt so you get visibility of where your package is. I highly recommend this brand. Love them.
They sent the wrong size and wouldn't do anything about it so I had to return it myself and wait 3 weeks for a refund.
Been shopping with Zalando for years - both from the Danish website and UK website - and it’s always a great experience.My purchases has always arrived within max 3 days (most often next day) and refunding items is easy done as orders comes with a return label.
Returned a pair of jeans and still have not received my refund. Looking at the other reviews I'm not the only person who has been ripped off by this company. Do not buy from these crooks.
"Order number 10501015390457 Ordered 2 items sent 1. When I questioned why this happened I was told these things can happen on rare occasions. Fill in a legal form and send back to us. I was sent wrong returns form, I spoke to three different people to get the actual missing items form.I filled that in correctly and was told it was incorrect because I did not put my home address has delivery address, I reminded them that delivery was click and collect at my local shop.I still had to fill form in again.I called in again and I was told you lot need to patient. Which was because of my ethnicity, SYSTEMATIC RACISUM!. THen  I was told I was stupid because I could not read simple instructions.I suffer with a mental illness that does not make me stupid or illiterate!. All the customer service agents were rude.I’m being penalised for being mentally vulnerable.Today they said they will not assist me in finding my missing parcel. According to them they sent both items. Whic is not true!They said file a police complaint!. I contacted police and they said it’s a civil matter not a criminal matter.I contacted Zalando they are rude and racist. They refuse to help.I have instructed my bank to start chargeback dispute.Honest the worst company I have dealt with. Please stay away from this racist and cowboy company. They make fun of mentally ill people. I’m a victim in this!.I am so depressed after being treated in such an inhuman way!. Mentally and psychologically I’m drained."
"I've been using Zalando website for the last few years and I always paid by Paypal in full with no problems. Some three months ago the Paypal option disappeared from my account without an explanation (although website claims Paypal is accepted payment form) and now I can only pay by typing my card number each time I make a purchase so I stopped using their website and I will delete my account as I find this unsafe to do on my mobile which I use for most buys. Customer service (which was useless and could not explain why the option was removed) can only be reached by phone or Twitter, no option of official complaint form or email."
"Excellent range of brands at a good price. Website easy to navigate. Purchased clothes many times from Zalando and theyve been great quality. Only downside is dispatch and delivery takes a while, no option for express delivery. I can't believe the negative reviews! I've always had great shopping experience and refunds are processed quickly."
"I was looking for a specific sport closing and found it on Zalando site only as well as I was very limited in time. I was in doubt but my order has had arrived exactly in time I requested. General impression- perfect service, quick respond from Zalando team, good quality and original goods. Trustful and reliable site, surely will come back here for shopping.Vladimir Sokol"
"I am honestly surprised by the negative reviews here. I recently ordered two pairs of shoes and they arrived on time in perfect condition and as expected. I had looked here before ordering and was a little bit skeptical seeing the poor rating, but I took a leap of faith as credit card always acts as a backup. In any case, I think the products are great with great discounts on the site and it works like any other normal e-commerce website. However, I have not had the experience of returning something yet so I can't comment on that."
Didn’t receive the correct refund for the returned items and then they told me they can’t refund me due to security reasonsScammers stole my money!!!
"Two months ago I returned a dress and I was waiting for my refund. Instead getting my refund they charged me again with the same amount. I had to call to my bank, and to get a new card, cause I thought that this isn’t Normal, To get my money from my account without authorization. I got my refund after two weeks. Few days ago I ordered again from them even if I was a little bit worried to not happen to me the same thing. Today I received my parcel shipped by Hermès. The parcel was open and two items were missing. I called them and they told me that I will get my refund. And the same thing happened to me. I was waiting for an email where was supposed to be written something about it. After one hour I see that THEY LITERALLY CHARGED ME INSTEAD OF GIVING ME BACK MY REFUND. This is not normal. I called back to them and the same guy told me that I will get my money back in 5 days. So I hope that I will get the money from the items were missing and also the money they charged me instead of giving me back. I’m from Finland and I ordered a lot of times there from Zalando and never but never happened this. And now when I came here, I have to be worried all the time that they don’t take my money whenever they want."
"Recently bought Apple of Eden lace up shoes from Zalando, (delivery and returns service is great 4 stars)!They are made from fine, soft, grey suede leather, with soft leather lining. Article number: AP211E009-C11Tried them on with liner socks, noticed lumps in the outside of the shoe. Inner lining of both shoes, wasn't adequately cut to size; so there were gaps and holes in the lining, which lumped up when the shoe was on. Some parts weren't stuck down.Returned, and asked for a better made pair, and these too, had similar issues. Cost £79.00, Company offered refund, but would not reduce price.Made in Portugal which is renowned for making such good quality shoes.Hope the people who made them are OK, and Zalando (Berlin based company), paid them well, end workers never get paid well, suppliers take the big cut..."
"Read so many bad reviews, was worried about ordering from here but I found a very hard to find item for a very good price and their service has been excellent from delivery to return."
"Ordered 2x pairs Nike socks 3 pack and they arrived 2 days later, I was skeptical after reading reviews on here but I’ve got to say my experience has been nothing but perfect, packaging was great, item 100% as described, please do not believe everything you read 5-5* from me will now order again soon, I highly recommend Zalando.co.uk"
"I usually don’t write reviews unless it’s very bad or very good !I’ve ordered several items on Zalando and most of the cloths didn’t fit properly has the sizing wasn’t accurate. But still it’s ok sizing is always tricky when you order online.The issue was concerning the return policy. I’ve sent back 3 orders to them and 2 had been double charged on my account... it’s quite a lot I think!They told me it was a technical error and they will fix it. One and a half week after the refund on the first order hasn’t been refunded yet and got double charged again on that same order . Mistake can happen but when the customer service don’t really care about fixing your issue that’s what makes me angry.Anyway my advice, don’t order on zalando if you have an issue it will take ages to be fixed (if you are lucky) shop with H&M they are much better company."
"Had a look on here before ordering and as some other people have said, I didn’t have any problems and don’t understand the negative feedback. Not saying the bad reviews aren’t legit, but I can only go on my experience. In short, I saw an advert for the england away shirt at a sale price. Ordered it on Sunday, got a confirmation email straight away. Got a delivery in transit email yesterday. And it arrived about 5 minutes ago. 3 days to arrive from time of ordering, plenty of notifications. Can’t fault them."
"I had ordered a poor quality pair of shoes from Shoe The Bear (leather was not as advertised), they were wearing off very quickly.I sent them back, really not having much hope on whether or not Zalando would understand my point.And not only, they have been very helpful with helping me sending it back, they have been very quick at analysing and realising the product defect and refunding me. Amazing !!"
"I ordered a top and 2 coats - they sent me the wrong top and one of the coats was dirty. When I tried to return the items, the Hermes label they had sent me did not scan in the Hermes shop and I was unable to post the parcel. I asked Zalando to send me a QR code as I did not have a printer but they sent me a label that needed to be printed and again, didn't work in the parcel shop. They told me they'd post a label to me which could take 2 weeks  - this did not turn up so I requested they send another. A month later and neither label has turned up but they refuse to refund me until I return the parcel, when its their mistakes that are preventing me. They refuse to allow you to speak to a manager, get a call back or escalate a complaint. I repeatedly told them I was escalating this under the consumer rights act 2015, which they have still not acknowledged.  I have finally got my money back via my bank - Zalando refused to refund me when it was their faults that were preventing me returning their FAULTY items. Incredibly frustrating and zero recognition of their repeated errors or effort to make it right."
"I brought for myself and Adidas hoodieWear it once , after all came with little cotton balls all over the hoodieI don’t believe that is an authentic AdidasIt’s very low quality , probably fakeI would never shop again"
Great experience overall with a good selection quick delivery and easy returns
Sent wrong size of shoe. Said couldn't do an exchange. Would have to return and then re order. Said it could take 4 weeks to get my refund due to covid. Ha ha!!!  Covid didn't stop my money going immediately to them when I ordered! When I said I didn't want to order again in case the same thing happened. They said it definitely wouldn't. How can they say that? Will never order from them again.
"I would of gave them a zero if possible. I went against my good conscious ordering from this company after seeing such bad ratings and reviews.I ordered a pair of astro turf football boots. The only reason I ordered from here was they were the only company who had the colour and size I wanted available in stock.They ended up sending me a complete different colour and the boots were expensive.People don't buy from them, they are terrible!!!"
"Zalando used to be great until Brexit.Now delivery takes forever...And there is one more strange thing...What I don’t understand is, every time I want to order a product size M- they want to charge me £3 for long distance delivery, at the same time for absolutely the same product in size L or S delivery is free.I would like someone to explain that to me, one would think that products from same brand would be in one place in every size, but no, it’s always size M requires £3 delivery fee from apparent long distance..."
"The warehouse are full of thieves!! Every single time I return multiple items, they never get refunded. Always 1 item missing from the refund. After reading reviews i am not the only one who the warehouse are stealing from!!!"
"I do honestly think Zalando is a great company, however I'm rather disappointed with my recent order. Ordered a handful of products about 10 days ago. Was sent an email to confirm that it has been shipped however the parcel never showed up. I contacted the customer service team and was told that it was never actually handed over to the currier and that I will get a refund and can reorder if I still want the items. I imagined a small discount or a goodwill gesture would've been the least to apologise for the inconvenience but none was offered."
"Iv ordered products from here couple of years ago, there product measurements are wrong and the clothes end up getting returned."
"I purchased a pair of trainers from Zalando they didn’t fit so I arranged online for them to be collected from home with the service they offer-the trainers were not collected after two days of waiting for them to collect I took the trainers to a Hermes shop myself,what a useless service-will not use Zalando again!!!"
"Even though Zalando offers a collection of lot of items, their Delivery Company Hermes lost my parcel two bloody times in a row! I'm not ordering ANYTHING from them anymore!"
"Amazing experience. I can't seem to understand the reviews regarding returns and refunds. I have returned 2 items and the process was very simple. Refund issued in 3 days. The prices are extremely cheap, I could not find cheaper prices anywhere else online for certain products. They do take 2 or maybe 3 days sometimes shipping orders however  this is due to Covid. They have never failed to deliver an item, all authentic clothing. No issues whatsoever. I would definitely recommend shopping here. Thank you!!!"
"It’s extremely well organised online shop with vast variety of clothes,shoes,bags etc.Abundance of designer and non designer brands with really good offers.There’s 100 day policy rule, returns are very easy ,picked up from your door too. If you can read English and and follow the instructions there’s no problem. I’ve shopping with them for a long time , I swear I never had a problem with delivery or return.I like too many things so  I always order more to choose or two sizes if I am not sure and then return what I don’t keep.I highly recommend!"
I am very happy to shop on Zalando. Great variety of products and speedy delivery. Customer service is excellent 👌
Everything went great. I returned one item and there has been no problem with anything.
"awful experience with the return of an order.i will never never buy again from Zalando due to the extremely poor return process.I have placed an order which arrived and non of the items I have order were good to keep. I have decided to return the order which was 2 big boxes of stuff. I followed the Information for a return and placed there return Hermes labels on the box. nearest Hermes from off was 15min. away from my home. I had to carry those 2 boxes in the rain, got soaked wet and at the end, the staff at the shop refused to take my parcels due to label problem. Had to carry the boxes back home and I wont tell you how frustrated I was to waste my time on walking to the shop just get told that labels are not good+ get soaked wet+ ruining my night with my wife due to this. Next day I contacted Zalando customer service and got reassured that QR code will be send to my email, so no printing facility will be needed at home. decided to walk again with the boxes in the rain to the nearest post office. Quest what, the new labels did not have a QR code as staff promised, so I had to go and print the labels somewhere and come back to post them. what a joke! At the end I spend £2 for printing the labels + £3 for sealing tape, total of £5, just because I have been misinformed and screwed up by Zalando. That was the most awful experience ever had with a return.never again with them! so disorganised company and non reliable. got wet 2 days in a row to post the parcels+ wasted £5 on posting + wasted valuable time.It is your decision if you want to go through the same pain and inconveniences/waste of money and time"
"I would like to leave a review as I simply love ZALANDO! I am shopping on this website for quite a few years now and I must say, I never ever had a bad experience! Nearly enough always find what I want. I occasionally had to send items back and when I did, I always had my refund back without any problems.  Every now and then I had to deal with customer service and they were always very helpful.I really don't understand why the bad reviews? If I would've been someone who would've discovered the website through the reviews, I would've been put off.Keep up the good work Zalando and many thanks for the very versatile choices!"
"Ordered nike trainers I wanted that I couldn't find in my size on any other website , ordered them Friday afternoon and they were delivered Monday morning.  Perfect fit and lovely quick delivery . I was dubious as had read a few bad reviews but Highly recommend. Would definitely order from them again"
"I was a bit sceptic with the number of poor reviews although due to availability of the trainers (Jordan 1mid hyper blue) I wanted, so I gave them a chance. Have to say, excellent delivery and trainers arrived and fitted as expected and are 100% genuine.  Look great on, thanks. I will use again. My partner also informed me she used them previously for a pair of trainers and same experience  👍🏻"
"I'd heard about Zalando but had never bought from the website before. Bought some Doc Martens that had sold out everywhere else I'd looked. Were the same price as all the other sites. Signed up for the newsletter and got £10 off. Quick delivery, got what I wanted. Happy customer!"
At first I was suspicious because my friend's experience with Zaland. But when I bought my blue Nike Air Force 1's i got real original one's not replicas. And if you get wrong shoe sizes it's probably because you ordered wrong and you just bought what your current shoes sizes are not what your feet matches with. So please be prepared when buying in Zalando.
"Purchased a pair of shoes from these guys.Sent them back as they were a little ""pinching"" as a tight fit.I had worn them to try them for work, only walking in the office and upstairs.When returning them, it took ages for a reply!Then I was told I cannot have a return accepted as they were used. HOW ELSE ARE YOU SUPPOSE TO KNOW THEY FIT!!I purchased a pair of Skechers shoes before this and these were the replacement as the Skechers didn't fit and I'd worn them. Skechers took them back no questions asked and I got a full refund - with postage!I thought I would try these guys as an alternative to a brand I know, but I'll definitely be sticking to Skechers from now on!Not a happy or returning customer 🤕"
"Okay so, i ordered sweat pants (tie dye) in the picture on 'Zalando model as they claim' the pants were white/grey , everyone that ordered these got completely different color pants ( dark purple/blue ) I wrote a review saying that this seems to be zalando's problem rather then missguided and they wont even upload it , SHADY af makes you think how much stuff from their website is completely different IRL then their pictures ."
"I’ve ordered from Zalando three times recently. The first time, some parts of my order were randomly cancelled, the second time it just didn’t arrive and I was told it had got lost and the third time part of the order was cancelled again"
"I bought sportswear from another shop but found it here cheaper on Zalando, I sent it back to the first shop and ordered here. I saved £26. My order arrived quickly. I would use again. Thank you."
"Awful - called twice regarding missing order for my wife. 2 weeks ago was told would look into it. Just been  told delivered by Hermes & left in A BLACK BIN 20 days ago!! No card through door. Bin been collected twice since then. Called to request refund, cancel order etc. Martin refused, wouldn't give head office address or email, refused to pass to manager etc"
I didn’t have a single problem. Very quick delivery. Very cheap and very easy. I 100% recommend
"Immensely frustrating business!Bought a pair of Nike running shoes that broke on the first run. Being used to dealing with Nike directly I expected them to resolve the issue.Zalando offered me a £35 refund, which is baffling! Why would I want to keep a pair of broken running shoes???Now they tell me I have to buy another pair (rather than simply exchange) in the hope that they'll fully refund me.A nice website and app, but it's a smokescreen for a poor e-commerce business. they simply don't get how to look after a customer and therefore guarantee repeat business! Shameful. I won't be shopping with them again. Fact!"
"They sent me the wrong item and won't offer me a discount for THEIR mistake 😂So now I have to waste my precious lunch hour to go to the post office, wait in line for an hour before coming home. Because they sent me an item I didn't ask for.Never again."
"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MISSING PARCELSI have been ordering from Zalando for a few years now and quite frequently so I expected better. Recently their customer service has gone completely downhill. I had a £200 worth parcel go missing and I had to wait for 3-4 weeks for them to finally take action and all they did was refund me the money. The items by now have doubled in price and they gave me only 3 days to reorder the items and that they will refund the price difference. Well all the items were out of stock and when they finally came back in stock I called them, they said the 3 days have passed so they can't do anything about it. Not discount code, nothing. They had no care for me as a loyal customer. On top of that this year they introduced long delivery for a lot of items, that you have to pay £3 for which was never a thing before. I have really liked ordering from them previously but recently it's been getting worse and unfortunately I don't think I will be ordering from them again."
I read a lot of negative reviews after I ordered an item on line but I must say that my experience with Zalando UK is one of the best and the fastest.Quick and professional service. Item in perfect condition.If they ever had a bad service It seems they have improved it and I will trust Zalando again if I need to purchase anything from it.
"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! HORIBBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I BOUGHT GOODS WORTH 800$ and I received half of my items! The packaging was damaged and they blame the third party who handled my package! As soon as I told them I use a courier service to ship items to Kenya, their attitude towards me completely changed and they said there is nothing they can do! Damaged package, lost items and they have refused to help me further. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SITE! DO NOT! THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY AND THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT ITThey ARE Horrible ! AVOID AT ALL COSTS! THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY AND LOSE YOUR PACKAGES AND WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT!"
Terrible service.I would prefer not to give this company any stars.I placed an order for the first time that said it would take 3-5 days for delivery. Over a week later I get an email saying it has a short delay however will be with me soon.Another 10 days later still nothing no tracking so I email them to ask how much longer this will take the next morning. I receive a refund. At this point I call them and the say well the parcel is missing so if I want it I need to order again.! I asked to make an official complaint they say well we can feed this back but you will not get a response. And had a horrible attitude of not caring at all about keeping a first time customer it’s missing that’s that see ya type attitude. So I would be very weary of ordering from this company because they do not have a nice attitude or care for customers at all. I have waited for this summer jacket that should have arrived a few weeks ago and now have received a refund. Obviously I will not be using this company again. I have considered ordering from them before and have never been sure however I decided to go for it and what a waste of time that was. Poor service and no care for customers at all.
"Items were good and cheap, delivery was reasonably fast and they even picked up some items I wanted to return free of charge and refunded me for them.Honestly can't complain at all - even Hermes didn't let me down"
Zalando wad going to resolve my issue following a bad review and “make it right”yet never resolved anything and just said that they “noted my feedback” when i got in touch.
"They did not refund my money-Avoid buying from them-I sent the item back they didn’t refund meI emailed them for two months,nobody replied.I tried to call them directly and they said we received the box but it’s empty and can’t refund my money which is absolutely lieDon’t buy from them"
"Excellent service couldn’t find my item anywhere else apart from Zalando ordered two days ago and they estimated 3-5 days delivery and it arrived in 2 days! Excellent service used Zalando for a while and had 0 problems with them, trusted partner !"
"Great quality products. Have ordered from here twice now, arrived quickly with no fuss."
"Was a bit skeptical at first, but decided to buy some Nike Air Force 1s. They came in the delivery window, and were in brand new condition as you would expect. Great service!"
"I am absolutely furious.I brought some Moschino trainers from this website and paid £200. I received them on 11/03/2021 and after wearing the trainers 3 times, the branding which is down the front of each trainer, was completely fading. I therefore returned the item within 25 days. I am now being refused a refund because I wore the trainers?!!! That’s absurd...,yes I wore the trainers only to find that the branding is all but completing disappearing after only wearing them not even a handful of times. Zalando don’t seem to understand that consumers have rights and goods should be fit for purpose. Was I suppose to simply put the trainers on my shelf and look at them?!! Nike, Adidas, and many other brands would absolutely offer a no quibble refund. This should not happen to a pair of trainers ; certainly not ones that cost £200! I am literally taking this company to the Consumer Rights Ombudsman and will litigate out of principle if I am not given a resolution. I was even happy to exchange for another pair of trainers but for a different brand. I have to wonder if these really are authentic Moschino trainers because I have never had this with Moschino before from other stores! Shame on you Zalando!!"
"This is my first review on Trustpilot - this is how I got motivated to share my terrible experience with Zalando. I made my order 9.03, 20 days later I contacted the customer service to be told that my order wasn't even looked after/started. I was adviced to cancel the order, which I did. After 2 days the cancellation request was still pending so I contacted them again to be told it will be solved in 2 days... This is over 1 month now, I contacted them again and I'm still waiting for my money back...Worse shop and customer service ever... time and money wasting... AVOID!!!"
Excellent service very nice quality 5 star
They lost my delivery for £900 and keep wasting my time... They made me do a police report for theft ?? and told me there  is nothing they are going to do SHAMELESS
"Zalando spends too much time at delivering, and they also lie in the statements. I ordered a package 5 days ago, and it has still not arrived. When i ordered it said «delivery time takes 3-6 days». It was yesterday that i recieved a mail saying my package just got sent and will arrive in 3-6 days. Technically will it so arrive in 12 days from the day i ordered. Very bad service. I haver ordered from zalando before too, and i got the wrong package."
Absolutely awful service.  Do not rely on delivery dates given when ordering products.  No contact to warn you about problems. No real understanding by company that this could cause problems.  Literally do not use unless you don’t mind when good arrive.
"Extremely slow delivery have ordered numerous times from Zalando and each time the order takes at least 2 weeks or more to arrive which is really not acceptable in today's world of e-commerce. Amazon can deliver with 23/48 hours so why not Zalando, maybe because snail mail is much cheaper."
Recieved shoes that where cleary used avoid
"Absolutely love this website, fast shipping, great deals and huge variety. 💯💯💯💙💙💙"
"Brilliant!! My first order with Zalando which were a pair of Gabor trainers. I’d seen what I wanted on the John Lewis website but they didn’t have my size and found them here. They are a brand new pair, unwrapped and all intact with crisp new tissue wrapping. The fit is perfect and they also came with a prepaid returns label for Hermes. Will definitely being using Zalando again 100% ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"A terrible service and then very unhelpful. We ordered a tracksuit for my son. it said 2-4 days and yet 2 weeks later we have heard nothing ! So I checked and it seems they returned our parcel. Okay, so far maybe it could be down to the courier but then when I emailed them we just get an reply saying there was a problem and they can't resend it. So I contact customer service and basically it seems like they never had the items and just made excuses. Terrible all round. Do not recommend at all"
"This company sells Fraudulent Items! All Counterfeit!I bought a pair of designer shoes in size 7, then and purchased the same from thr actual designer store as I wanted 2 pairs and was told the one I was wearing was Fake, and when I tried a size at the designer store, the Real one fitted well whilst Zalando's one was loose as hell!"
Absolutely s**t. The customer service here is awful and the warehouse workers are obviously stupid. I wouldn't even give them one star if I could because they are just S**T!!
"Without going into long and protracted reasons why their service is so poor, just take it as read that I have been m motivated enough to leave a review. It was a toss between that or not being arsed.Do yourself a favour and steer well clear of this shambolic outfit.Have a nice day."
"Fixed an order that went wrong on oneills.cm came quickly at a good price, great service"
"I have made recently a few orders with Zalando, they arrived quickly and with no problems. Customer service is great, I had a question regarding the return and they helped me. When I returned some items I got refunded within a few days!"
I ordered some Vans Sliders 2 days ago and they came this morning. Speedy delivery and item is perfect.
"FIRST CLASS SERVICE!!DELIGHTFUL ANNA FIELD BAG,GREAT QUALITY,EXCELLENT VALUE,SPEEDY SERVICE FROM BERLIN!!I AM VERY,VERY PLEASED AND I DO RECOMMEND!E.Videnova"
"Zalando have some interesting things on their website though the pricing is not particularly competitive. They dispatch reasonably promptly however what lets them down is that they use Hermes as a delivery company and Hermes is just the worst delivery company there is. At the current time I have been waiting over a week for a delivery which Zalando dispatched on Tuesday of last week but Hermes only acknowledged receipt of on Saturday. It's now Wednesday and Hermes claim this package was out for delivery on Monday. Needless to say, I don't have it and neither company is responding to my enquiry of where it is.It's just not good enough. No doubt they will hide behind C19 but a year in only a poor company does that, it's now normal and they need to deal accordingly."
I registered with Zalando for a couple of months now and have purchased quite a few items. Their service is 100% and delivery is very prompt. I had to contact them yesterday as an item of clothing I had purchased had a hole in the front after just a couple of “wears” and one hand wash. Their communication with me was prompt and efficient. Today I was reimbursed and I didn’t have to return the item! Extremely impressed.
Terrible website. Do not recommend
"I bought a NEW Topshop Jeans Skinny Fit - black Size: 28x30 Quantity: 1 at the price of  £43.99  Order DateSat, 20 Mar 2021 Order number :10504014834957and received a used , washed ,were dry, shrunken, colour washed ( not black ) ,strongly perfumed , WITH OUT TAGS  trousers. That was a gift for my daughter and we were  in shock ,when we open it and saw it . That is AWFUL!!!!! They should be ashamed!!!! . Someone packed a used trousers .Who ever did it who work in this company and prepared this order should be sucked that's all. Just returned them as DAMAGE ( used , no tags ) and waiting for a refund.First time I have experienced something like this.Just be aware of this Company."
"Really disappointed with Zalando, and would advise shopping elsewhere! I placed an order on the 14th March and on the 16th March received an email to say it was on its way. Today (29th March) I followed up with zalando because I still haven’t received my order and to my shock I was told I will not be receiving my order! I find it very concerning that they took my money, failed to deliver and the only reason I got a refund was because I contacted them! Seems they were aware of the error but didn’t inform me until I asked. Recommend shopping elsewhere. I’ve been back on and can see both items are still in stock in the right size which makes me think it’s a complete scam because otherwise they would have sent my order to me instead of just refunding which was their default!"
"Zolando in the past had been a decent company but as of late there service is nothing short of abysmal, they have sent me the wrong items in the last three orders I have made and when confronted about it via email there staff gave robotic cookie cutter responses which left me more frustrated.I will never be using this companies services again as they have failed to hit any kind of marks or standards set by a modern business. There customer service is garbage and there quality assurance is non existent. Avoid at all costs. The only positive I can single out from this experience is the fast response to my emails but they felt pointless to receive and read."
"Cannot believe this! Ordered a dress for my daughters 1st birthday. I ordered a 12-18 month dress, they sent me out a 9-12!!! Which did not fit on the day and totally ruined everything! I called up complaining the lady on the phone said to me sorry and she will give a complimentary next day free delivery once i return the current dress and order a new one. Been 7 days no collection has been made from Hermes. So i called up AGAIN, now the guy goes to me there is no “next day delivery” because of brexit! So i wasted my time! I will never shop again!!"
"Avoid Zelando: horrid customer service is joke. Bought PUMA what was supposed to be Tracksuit bottoms but instead got cheap crappy fabric summery light cotton material pants,  XXL size which were half calf knee. Return instructions message to be taken to HERMES but return label was UPS, so I had to call customer services to find out how to return. Shipment late, no refund yet. Waste of time and effort, disgrace."
Rubbish service delivered my item to the wrong house and refused a refund
"Really poor company ...I waited for my shipment for 7 days and it wrote that the order was sentwhen I wrote to them, it turned out that they still did not send it ...I do not recommend"
"First  pair of Candice Cooper shoes arrived, Crost Bianco colour, and came with bright white laces they should have been off white laces to match shoe. Called Customer Services who didn’t want to know and said fill out the form on line. I thought they might say sorry and send me the correct laces. An automated response said send them back which we did. Bought a second pair and exactly the same problem they came with wrong laces. No quality control at all. Called CS again to be told procedures dictate you send them back or send photos and then send them back. Great!Phoned Candice Cooper in Italy and they said oh yes Zalando sorry sorry sorry!Waste of time, money and effort.I wrote to CEO twice and didn’t even get an acknowledgment from him or his team.Terrible company avoid."
Quality control Zalando... very bad. Ordered a Dorothy Perkins jumper and when it arrived it had a large hole in the front. Looked used too. Really disappointing.
"I bought a Michael Kors bag. It arrived in a flimsy bag with scratches all over the metal work. It had clearly been used and returned. The bag was £310 and the service I got was appalling. I was emailing for days with useless responses and being told to use a claims page that wasn’t even working! And then I phoned and was put through to a man called Marcelo who after a few minutes was refusing to help and stating that my circumstances were irrelevant and I had to follow the process despite of whenever the site will be fixed. This is almost a week after I received the item and it is only 14 days return policy. He continued shouting at me down the phone when I complained about his customer service and didn’t let me get a word in before he ended the phone call abruptly. I have never received such abuse, and the bag is being returned. What a disgusting company."
"So I returned a pair of boots, and the tracking clearly shows they are delivered. The tracking number is available to Zalando, because after all, its their returns service. However the refund hasn't been made, and I've been told that their own tracking confirmation isn't sufficient. I now have to download a form, print it out, complete it, and scan it back to them. What happens if I don't have a printer or a scanner? It's a ridiculously time consuming and complex way to resolve a problem that I didn't cause. I asked for a complaint escalation and no details have been provided of that either."
Was very sceptical at first because of all the past negative reviews. However I’m glad I took the risk and ordered from here as it came promptly and hassle free. Would happily use zalando again.
